    "data": "Cybercriminals abuse Online Social Networks (OSNs) to lure victims into a variety of spam. Among different spam types, a less explored area is OSN abuse that leverages the telephony channel to defraud users. Phone numbers are advertized via OSNs, and users are tricked into calling these numbers. To expand the reach of such scam / spam campaigns, phone numbers are advertised across multiple platforms like Facebook, Twitter, GooglePlus, Flickr, and YouTube. In this paper, we present the first data-driven characterization of cross-platform campaigns that use multiple OSN platforms to reach their victims and use phone numbers for monetization. We collect 23M posts containing 1.8M unique phone numbers from Twitter, Facebook, GooglePlus, Youtube, and Flickr over a period of six months. Clustering these posts helps us identify 202 campaigns operating across the globe with Indonesia, United States, India, and United Arab Emirates being the most prominent originators. We find that even though Indonesian campaigns generate highest volume (3.2M posts), only 1.6% of the accounts propagating Indonesian campaigns have been suspended so far. By examining campaigns running across multiple OSNs, we discover that Twitter detects and suspends 93% more accounts than Facebook. Therefore, sharing intelligence about abuse-related user accounts across OSNs can aid in spam detection. According to our dataset, around 35K victims and 8.8M USD could have been saved if intelligence was shared across the OSNs. By analyzing phone number based spam campaigns running on OSNs, we highlight the unexplored variety of phone-based attacks surfacing on OSNs.",

By aggregating users' flags, our goal is to select a small subset of news every day, send them to an expert (e.g., via a third-party fact-checking organization), and stop the spread of news identified as fake by an expert. The main objective of our work is to minimize the spread of misinformation by stopping the propagation of fake news in the network. It is especially challenging to achieve this objective as it requires detecting fake news with high-confidence as quickly as possible. We show that in order to leverage users' flags efficiently, it is crucial to learn about users' flagging accuracy. We develop a novel algorithm, DETECTIVE, that performs Bayesian inference for detecting fake news and jointly learns about users' flagging accuracy over time. Our algorithm employs posterior sampling to actively trade off exploitation (selecting news that maximize the objective value at a given epoch) and exploration (selecting news that maximize the value of information towards learning about users' flagging accuracy).

We propose several algorithms that outperform the previous studies both on the theoretical approximation ratios and on the experimental performance. Under the case where the nodes have heterogeneous costs, our algorithms are the first bi- criteria approximation algorithms with polynomial running time and provable logarithmic performance bounds using a general contagion model. Under the case where the users have uniform costs, our algorithms achieve logarithmic approximation ratio and provable time complexity which is smaller than that of existing algorithms in orders of magnitude. We conduct extensive experiments using real social networks. The experimental results show that, our algorithms significantly outperform the existing algorithms both on the total cost and on the running time, and also scale well to billion-scale networks.",

    "data": "Popular User-Review Social Networks (URSNs)---such as Dianping, Yelp, and Amazon---are often the targets of reputation attacks in which fake reviews are posted in order to boost or diminish the ratings of listed products and services. These attacks often emanate from a collection of accounts, called Sybils, which are collectively managed by a group of real users. A new advanced scheme, which we term elite Sybil attacks, recruits organically highly-rated accounts to generate seemingly-trustworthy and realistic-looking reviews. These elite Sybil accounts taken together form a large-scale sparsely-knit Sybil network for which existing Sybil fake-review defense systems are unlikely to succeed. In this paper, we conduct the first study to define, characterize, and detect elite Sybil attacks. We show that contemporary elite Sybil attacks have a hybrid architecture, with the first tier recruiting elite Sybil workers and distributing tasks by Sybil organizers, and with the second tier posting fake reviews for profit by elite Sybil workers. We design ElsieDet, a three-stage Sybil detection scheme, which first separates out suspicious groups of users, then identifies the campaign windows, and finally identifies elite Sybil users participating in the campaigns. We perform a large-scale empirical study on ten million reviews from Dianping, by far the most popular URSN service in China. Our results show that reviews from elite Sybil users are more spread out temporally, craft more convincing reviews, and have higher filter bypass rates. We also measure the impact of Sybil campaigns on various industries (such as cinemas, hotels, restaurants) as well as chain stores, and demonstrate that monitoring elite Sybil users over time can provide valuable early alerts against Sybil campaigns.",

We show that social network underlying the population can be harnessed to accomplish this task effectively, by sampling preferences of a small subset of representative nodes. We first develop a Facebook app to create a dataset consisting of preferences of nodes and the underlying social network, using which, we develop models that capture how preferences are distributed among nodes in a typical social network. We hence propose an appropriate objective function for the problem of selecting best representative nodes. We devise two algorithms, namely, Greedy-min which provides a performance guarantee for a wide class of popular voting rules, and Greedy-sum which exhibits excellent performance in practice. We compare the performance of these proposed algorithms against random-polling and popular centrality measures, and provide a detailed analysis of the obtained results. Our analysis suggests that selecting representatives using social network information is advantageous for aggregating preferences related to personal topics (e.g., lifestyle), while random polling with a reasonable sample size is good enough for aggregating preferences related to social topics (e.g., government policies).",

Compact, easy to read, summaries of these dialogues would thus be highly valuable. A priori, it is not even clear what form such a summary should take. Previous work on summarization has primarily focused on summarizing written texts, where the notion of an abstract of the text is well defined. We collect gold standard training data consisting of five human summaries for each of 161 dialogues on the topics of Gay Marriage, Gun Control and Abortion. We present several different computational models aimed at identifying segments of the dialogues whose content should be used for the summary, using linguistic features and Word2vec features with both SVMs and Bidirectional LSTMs. We show that we can identify the most important arguments by using the dialog context with a best F-measure of 0.74 for gun control, 0.71 for gay marriage, and 0.67 for abortion.",

    "data": "Online social networks (OSNs) have become the main medium for connecting people, sharing knowledge and information, and for communication. The social connections between people using these OSNs are formed as virtual links (e.g., friendship and following connections) that connect people. These links are the heart of today's OSNs as they facilitate all of the activities that the members of a social network can do. However, many of these networks suffer from noisy links, i.e., links that do not reflect a real relationship or links that have a low intensity, that change the structure of the network and prevent accurate analysis of these networks. Hence, a process for assessing and ranking the links in a social network is crucial in order to sustain a healthy and real network. Here, we define link assessment as the process of identifying noisy and non-noisy links in a network. In this paper, we address the problem of link assessment and link ranking in social networks using external interaction networks. In addition to a friendship social network, additional exogenous interaction networks are utilized to make the assessment process more meaningful. We employed machine learning classifiers for assessing and ranking the links in the social network of interest using the data from exogenous interaction networks. The method was tested with two different datasets, each containing the social network of interest, with the ground truth, along with the exogenous interaction networks. The results show that it is possible to effectively assess the links of a social network using only the structure of a single network of the exogenous interaction networks, and also using the structure of the whole set of exogenous interaction networks. The experiments showed that some classifiers do better than others regarding both link classification and link ranking.",

These rich attribute information of social actors reveal the homophily effect, exerting huge impacts on the formation of social networks. In this paper, we explore the rich evidence source of attributes in social networks to improve network embedding. We propose a generic Social Network Embedding framework (SNE), which learns representations for social actors (i.e., nodes) by preserving both the structural proximity and attribute proximity. While the structural proximity captures the global network structure, the attribute proximity accounts for the homophily effect. To justify our proposal, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world social networks.

In a networked game each player (user) takes action in response to other players' actions in order to decrease (increase) his cost (profit) in the network. We assume that the players' cost functions are not necessarily dependent on the actions of all players. This is due to better mimicking the standard social media rules. A communication graph is defined for the game through which players are able to share their information with only their neighbors. We assume that the communication neighbors necessarily affect the players' cost functions while the reverse is not always true. In this game, the players are only aware of their own cost functions and actions. Thus, each of them maintains an estimate of the others' actions and share it with the neighbors to update his action and estimates.",

In public health, researchers use data from social media to monitor disease spread, assess population attitudes toward health-related issues, and to better understand the relationship between behavioral changes and population health. However, a major limitation of the use of these data for population health research is a lack of key demographic indicators such as, age, race and gender. Several studies have proposed methods for automated detection of social media users' demographic characteristics. These range from facial recognition to classic supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. We seek to provide a review of existing approaches to automated detection of demographic characteristics of social media users. We also address the applicability of these methods to public health research; focusing on the challenge of working with highly dynamical, large scale data to study health trends.

Due in large part to the fuzzy nature of what constitutes suicidal risks, most supervised approaches for learning to automatically detect suicide-related activity in social media require a great deal of human labor to train. However, humans themselves have diverse or conflicting views on what constitutes suicidal thoughts. So how to obtain reliable gold standard labels is fundamentally challenging and, we hypothesize, depends largely on what is asked of the annotators and what slice of the data they label. We conducted multiple rounds of data labeling and collected annotations from crowdsourcing workers and domain experts. We aggregated the resulting labels in various ways to train a series of supervised models. Our preliminary evaluations show that using unanimously agreed labels from multiple annotators is helpful to achieve robust machine models.",

However, despite the widespread adoption of these features, there is little understanding of the consequences that social networking has on user retention, engagement, and online as well as offline behavior. Here, we study how social networks influence user behavior in a physical activity tracking application. We analyze 791 million online and offline actions of 6 million users over the course of 5 years, and show that social networking leads to a significant increase in users' online as well as offline activities. Specifically, we establish a causal effect of how social networks influence user behavior. We show that the creation of new social connections increases user online in-application activity by 30%, user retention by 17%, and user offline real-world physical activity by 7% (about 400 steps per day). By exploiting a natural experiment we distinguish the effect of social influence of new social connections from the simultaneous increase in user's motivation to use the app and take more steps. We show that social influence accounts for 55% of the observed changes in user behavior, while the remaining 45% can be explained by the user's increased motivation to use the app. Further, we show that subsequent, individual edge formations in the social network lead to significant increases in daily steps. These effects diminish with each additional edge and vary based on edge attributes and user demographics. Finally, we utilize these insights to develop a model that accurately predicts which users will be most influenced by the creation of new social network connections.",

In this paper, we classify post stance on social media channels and develop UTCNN, a neural network model that incorporates user tastes, topic tastes, and user comments on posts. UTCNN not only works on social media texts, but also analyzes texts in forums and message boards. Experiments performed on Chinese Facebook data and English online debate forum data show that UTCNN achieves a 0.755 macro-average f-score for supportive, neutral, and unsupportive stance classes on Facebook data, which is significantly better than models in which either user, topic, or comment information is withheld.

In contrast to existing studies that involve greedy approximation algorithms with a 63% performance guarantee, our work focuses on solving the problem optimally. To this end, we introduce a new class of problems that we refer to as two-stage stochastic submodular optimization models. We propose a delayed constraint generation algorithm to find the optimal solution to this class of problems with a finite number of samples. The influence maximization problems of interest are special cases of this general problem class. We show that the submodularity of the influence function can be exploited to develop strong optimality cuts that are more effective than the standard optimality cuts available in the literature.

As found by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 20 million Americans aged 12 years or older consumed illicit drugs in the past few 30 days. Given their ubiquity in everyday life, drug abuse related studies have received much and constant attention. However, most of the existing studies rely on surveys. Surveys present a fair number of problems because of their nature. Surveys on sensitive topics such as illicit drug use may not be answered truthfully by the people taking them. Selecting a representative sample to survey is another major challenge. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using big data from social media in order to understand illicit drug use behaviors. Instagram posts are collected using drug related terms by analyzing the hashtags supplied with each post. A large and dynamic dictionary of frequent illicit drug related slang is used to find these posts. These posts are studied to find common drug consumption behaviors with regard to time of day and week. Furthermore, by studying the accounts followed by the users of drug related posts, we hope to discover common interests shared by drug users.",

Most algorithms are limited to static snapshots, so they cannot handle dynamics within the underlying graph. In this paper we present a modification of the Louvain community detec- tion method to handle changes in the graph without rerunning the full algorithm. Also, we adapted the Louvain greedy approach to optimize the Infomap measure. The main idea is, to recalculate only a small area around the changes. Depending on the graph size and the amount of changes, this yields a massive runtime decrease. As validation data, we provide a graph generator, which produces spe- cific community structures, at given times and also intermediate steps to transform the graph from one to another specific graph. Experiments show that runtime decrease is possible without much loss of quality. These values depend on the reprocessed area inside the graph.",

In this paper, we consider the competition for attention in popular online social networks (OSNs) that usually employ a timeline-based homepage to sort messages chronologically in a limited visible region. A non-cooperative Tullock-like game model is formulated that consists of a finite amount of \\emph{benign} agents and one \\emph{malicious} agent. By paying to the OSN, each benign agent seeks to maximize his utility of visibility, while the malicious one aims to reduce the utilities of benign agents. Our primary purposes are to quantify how robust the overall performance of benign agents is against the malicious action, and how the OSN's revenue is influenced. We derive the upper and the lower bounds of six fundamental measures with regard to the total utility and the total net utility of benign agents and the OSN's revenue under three different scenarios: with and without the malicious agent, and the maximum. They capture the worst and the best performances of the benign agents as well as the OSN. Our study reveals two important insights: i) the performance bounds are very sensitive to the malicious agent's willingness to pay at certain ranges; ii) the OSN acquires more revenues from this malicious action.",

We also employed translated SentiWordNet in the sentiment classification. All the classifications were conducted with machine learning algorithms. The experimental results showed that the additional features are quite effective in the sarcasm detection.",

    "data": "With the quick development of online social media such as twitter or sina weibo in china, many users usually track hot topics to satisfy their desired information need. For a hot topic, new opinions or ideas will be continuously produced in the form of online data stream. In this scenario, how to effectively filter and display information for a certain topic dynamically, will be a critical problem. We call the problem as Topic-focused Dynamic Information Filtering (denoted as TDIF for short) in social media. In this paper, we start open discussions on such application problems. We first analyze the properties of the TDIF problem, which usually contains several typical requirements: relevance, diversity, recency and confidence. Recency means that users want to follow the recent opinions or news. Additionally, the confidence of information must be taken into consideration. How to balance these factors properly in online data stream is very important and challenging. We propose a dynamic preservation strategy on the basis of an existing feature-based utility function, to solve the TDIF problem. Additionally, we propose new dynamic diversity measures, to get a more reasonable evaluation for such application problems. Extensive exploratory experiments have been conducted on TREC public twitter dataset, and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach.",
