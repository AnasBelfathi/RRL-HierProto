    "data": "Event-based services have recently witnessed a rapid growth driving the way people explore and share information of interest. They host a huge amount of users' activities including explicit RSVP, shared photos, comments and social connections. Exploiting these activities to detect communities of similar users is a challenging problem. In reality, a community in event-based social network (ESBN) is a group of users not only sharing common events and friends, but also having similar topical interests. However, such community could not be detected by most of existing methods which mainly draw on link analysis in the network. To address this problem, there is a need to capitalize on the semantics of shared objects along with the structural properties, and to generate overlapping communities rather than disjoint ones. In this paper, we propose to leverage the users' activities around events with the aim to detect communities based on topical clustering and link analysis that maximize a new form of semantic modularity. We particularly highlight the difference between online and offline social interactions, and the influence of event categories to detect communities. Experimental results on real datasets showed that our approach was able to detect semantically meaningful communities compared with existing state of the art methods.",

Focusing on the German federal election campaign 2013, this article investigates whether election candidates address the topics most important to the mass audience and to which extent their communication is shaped by the characteristics of Facebook and Twitter. Based on open-ended responses from a representative survey conducted during the election campaign, we train a human-interpretable Bayesian language model to identify political topics. Applying the model to social media messages of candidates and their direct audiences, we find that both prioritize different topics than the mass audience. The analysis also shows that politicians use Facebook and Twitter for different purposes. We relate the various findings to the mediation of political communication on social media induced by the particular characteristics of audiences and sociotechnical environments.",

Knowledge extraction differs with respect to the application in which the research on cognitive science fed the necessities for the same. This work further moves forward such a research by extracting semantic information of streaming and batch data in applications like Named Entity Recognition and Author Profiling. In the case of Named Entity Recognition context of a single micro post has been utilized and context that lies in the pool of micro posts were utilized to identify the sociolect aspects of the author of those micro posts. In this work Conditional Random Field has been utilized to do the entity recognition and a novel approach has been proposed to find the sociolect aspects of the author (Gender, Age group).",

Assuming the social network nodes to be strategic in forming relationships, we derive conditions under which a given topology can be uniquely obtained. We also study the efficiency and robustness of the derived conditions. (2) Multi-phase Influence Maximization: We propose that information diffusion be carried out in multiple phases rather than in a single instalment. With the objective of achieving better diffusion, we discover optimal ways of splitting the available budget among the phases, determining the time delay between consecutive phases, and also finding the individuals to be targeted for initiating the diffusion process. (3) Scalable Preference Aggregation: It is extremely useful to determine a small number of representatives of a social network such that the individual preferences of these nodes, when aggregated, reflect the aggregate preference of the entire network. Using real-world data collected from Facebook with human subjects, we discover a model that faithfully captures the spread of preferences in a social network. We hence propose fast and reliable ways of computing a truly representative aggregate preference of the entire network. In particular, we develop models and methods for solving the above problems, which primarily deal with formation and analysis of social networks.",

    "data": "Code-mixing or code-switching are the effortless phenomena of natural switching between two or more languages in a single conversation. Use of a foreign word in a language; however, does not necessarily mean that the speaker is code-switching because often languages borrow lexical items from other languages. If a word is borrowed, it becomes a part of the lexicon of a language; whereas, during code-switching, the speaker is aware that the conversation involves foreign words or phrases. Identifying whether a foreign word used by a bilingual speaker is due to borrowing or code-switching is a fundamental importance to theories of multilingualism, and an essential prerequisite towards the development of language and speech technologies for multilingual communities. In this paper, we present a series of novel computational methods to identify the borrowed likeliness of a word, based on the social media signals. We first propose context based clustering method to sample a set of candidate words from the social media data. Next, we propose three novel and similar metrics based on the usage of these words by the users in different tweets; these metrics were used to score and rank the candidate words indicating their borrowed likeliness. We compare these rankings with a ground truth ranking constructed through a human judgment experiment. The Spearman's rank correlation between the two rankings (nearly 0.62 for all the three metric variants) is more than double the value (0.26) of the most competitive existing baseline reported in the literature. Some other striking observations are, (i) the correlation is higher for the ground truth data elicited from the younger participants (age less than 30) than that from the older participants, and (ii )those participants who use mixed-language for tweeting the least, provide the best signals of borrowing.",

    "data": "Science education is a crucial issue with long-term impacts for Europe as the low enrolment rates in the STEM-fields, including (natural) science, technology, engineering and mathematics, will lead to a workforce problem in research and development. In order to address this challenge, the EU-funded research project SciChallenge (project.scichallenge.eu) aims to find a new way for getting young people more interested in STEM. For this purpose, the project developed and implemented a social-media-based STEM-contest for young people, which aims at increasing the attractiveness of science education and careers among young people. In the first two parts, the paper reflects on the problem, introduces the project and highlights the main steps of the preparation of the contest. The third section of the paper presents the idea, design and implementation of the digital contest platform (www.scichallenge.eu), which serves as the core of the challenge. The fourth part of the paper will provide a status update on the contest pilot. It will provide a summary of the experiences that the consortium made with this novel approach as well as the main obstacles that the consortium was facing. The paper will conclude with a preliminary reflection on the question if such an approach can help to increase the interest of young people in STEM-education and careers.",

These schemes are published between 2008 and 2016. Based on this existing privacy preservation schemes, we survey privacy preservation models, including location privacy, identity privacy, anonymity, traceability, interest privacy, backward privacy, and content oriented privacy. The recent important attacks of leaking privacy, countermeasures, and game theoretic approaches in VSNs and MSNs are summarized in form of tables.

However, the current user profiling approaches have limited success, due to the lack of a principled way to integrate different types of social relationships of a user, and the reliance on scarcely-available labeled data in building a prediction model. In this paper, we present a novel solution termed Collective Semi-Supervised Learning (CSL), which provides a principled means to integrate different types of social relationship and unlabeled data under a unified computational framework. The joint learning from multiple relationships and unlabeled data yields a computationally sound and accurate approach to model user attributes in social media. Extensive experiments using Twitter data have demonstrated the efficacy of our CSL approach in inferring user attributes such as account type and marital status. We also show how CSL can be used to determine important user features, and to make inference on a larger user population.",

In such a setting it has been shown that information need not be aggregated and agents run a risk of herding on an inferior action. The other extreme, where agents do not observe each other at all clearly will not allow for social learning. In this paper we study the interim case where agents partly observe each other. We model partial observability by overlaying a graph structure over the agents. We consider the challenge of designing such a network structure that guarantees social learning. We introduce the `celebrity graph' and prove that it induces social learning and an optimal outcome with overwhelming probability.

    "data": "A number of recent studies of information diffusion in social media, both empirical and theoretical, have been inspired by viral propagation models derived from epidemiology. These studies model the propagation of memes, i.e., pieces of information, between users in a social network similarly to the way diseases spread in human society. Importantly, one would expect a meme to spread in a social network amongst the people who are interested in the topic of that meme. Yet, the importance of topicality for information diffusion has been less explored in the literature. Here, we study empirical data about two different types of memes (hashtags and URLs) spreading through the Twitter's online social network. For every meme, we infer its topics and for every user, we infer her topical interests. To analyze the impact of such topics on the propagation of memes, we introduce a novel theoretical framework of information diffusion. Our analysis identifies two distinct mechanisms, namely topical and non-topical, of information diffusion. The non-topical information diffusion resembles disease spreading as in simple contagion. In contrast, the topical information diffusion happens between users who are topically aligned with the information and has characteristics of complex contagion. Non-topical memes spread broadly among all users and end up being relatively popular. Topical memes spread narrowly among users who have interests topically aligned with them and are diffused more readily after multiple exposures. Our results show that the topicality of memes and users' interests are essential for understanding and predicting information diffusion.",

The comparison between the OSNs is insightful when it is done based on the representative majority of the users holding active accounts on all the platforms. In this research, we collected a set of user profiles holding accounts on both Twitter and Instagram, these platforms being of prominence among a majority of users. An extensive textual and visual analysis on the media content posted by these users revealed that both these platforms are indeed perceived differently at a fundamental level with Instagram engaging more of the users' heart and Twitter capturing more of their mind. These differences got reflected in almost every microscopic analysis done upon the linguistic, topical and visual aspects.",

This being a popular public opinion, these notions have not been based on any rigorous scientific study or research. In this paper, we revisit the cultural divide among the Indian population from a purely social networks based approach. We study the reservation system in detail, starting from its past and observing its effect on the people. Through a survey, we analyze the variation in behavioural characteristics exhibited towards members of the same caste group versus members from another caste group. We study the distinct cluster formation that takes place in the Indian community, and find that this is largely due to the effect of caste-based homophily. To study the social capital associated with each individual in the backward class, we define a new parameter called social distance. We study the changes that take place with regard to the average social distance of a cluster as well as network formation when a new link is established between the clusters which in its essence, is what the reservation system is accomplishing. Our extensive study calls for the change in the mindset of people in India. Although the animosity towards the reservation system could be rooted due to historical influence, hero worship and herd mentality, our results make it clear that the system has had a considerable impact in the country's overall development by bridging the gap between the conflicting social groups.",

    "data": "The overwhelming amount and rate of information update in online social media is making it increasingly difficult for users to allocate their attention to their topics of interest, thus there is a strong need for prioritizing news feeds. The attractiveness of a post to a user depends on many complex contextual and temporal features of the post. For instance, the contents of the post, the responsiveness of a third user, and the age of the post may all have impact. So far, these static and dynamic features has not been incorporated in a unified framework to tackle the post prioritization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for prioritizing posts based on a feature modulated multi-dimensional point process. Our model is able to simultaneously capture textual and sentiment features, and temporal features such as self-excitation, mutual-excitation and bursty nature of social interaction. As an evaluation, we also curated a real-world conversational benchmark dataset crawled from Facebook. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm is able to achieve the-state-of-the-art performance in terms of analyzing, predicting, and prioritizing events. In terms of interpretability of our method, we observe that features indicating individual user profile and linguistic characteristics of the events work best for prediction and prioritization of new events.",

Using Bluetooth-enabled smartphones to measure social connectivity is an alternative to traditional paper-based data collection; however studies employing this technology have been restricted to limited sets of homogenous handsets. We investigated the feasibility of using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol, present on users' own smartphones, to measure social connectivity. A custom application was designed for Android and iOS handsets. The app was configured to simultaneously broadcast via BLE and perform periodic discovery scans for other nearby devices. The app was installed on two Android handsets and two iOS handsets, and each combination of devices was tested in the foreground, background and locked states. Connectivity was successfully measured in all test cases, except between two iOS devices when both were in a locked state with their screens off. As smartphones are in a locked state for the majority of a day, this severely limits the ability to measure social connectivity on users' own smartphones.
