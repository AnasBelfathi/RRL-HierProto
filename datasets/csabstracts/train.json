Proper social network counter-measures are needed to combat these threats. Here we present one important counter-measure: penetrating social networks. This means making target users connect with or follow agents deployed in the social network. Once such connections are established with the targets, the agents can influence them by sharing content which counters the influence campaign.

During data routing and forwarding, a node can know others' interests only if they are affiliated with the same community. Moreover, to improve forwarding performance, a new metric {\\em community energy} is introduced to indicate vehicular social proximity.

PRIF considers this energy metric to select forwarders towards the destination node or the destination community. Security analysis indicates PRIF can protect nodes' interest information.

    "data": "Recent years have witnessed a significant trend towards filling the gap between Social Network Analysis (SNA) and control theory. This trend was enabled by the introduction of new mathematical models describing dynamics of social groups, the development of algorithms and software for data analysis and the tremendous progress in understanding complex networks and multi-agent systems (MAS) dynamics. The aim of this tutorial is to highlight a novel chapter of control theory, dealing with dynamic models of social networks and processes over them, to the attention of the broad research community. In its first part [1], we have considered the most classical models of social dynamics, which have anticipated and to a great extent inspired the recent extensive studies on MAS and complex networks. This paper is the second part of the tutorial, and it is focused on more recent models of social processes that have been developed concurrently with MAS theory. Future perspectives of control in social and techno-social systems are also discussed.",

    "data": "The workforce remains the most basic element of social production, even in modern societies. Its migration, especially for developing economies such as China, plays a strong role in the reallocation of productive resources and offers a promising proxy for understanding socio-economic issues. Nevertheless, due to long cycle, expensive cost and coarse granularity, conventional surveys face challenges in comprehensively profiling it. With the permeation of smart and mobile devices in recent decades, booming social media has essentially broken spatio-temporal constraints and enabled the continuous sensing of the real-time mobility of massive numbers of individuals. In this study, we demonstrate that similar to a natural shock, the Spring Festival culturally drives workforce travel between workplaces and hometowns, and the trajectory footprints from social media therefore open a window with unparalleled richness and fine granularity to explore laws in national-level workforce migration. To understand the core driving forces of workforce migration flux between cities in China, various indicators reflecting the benefits and costs of migration are introduced into our prediction model. We find that urban GDP (gross domestic product) and travel time are two excellent indicators to help make predictions. Diverse migration patterns are then revealed by clustering the trajectories, which give important clues to help understand the different roles of Chinese cities in their own development and in regional economic development. These patterns are further explained as a joint effect of the subjective will to seek personal benefits and the capacity requirements of local labour markets. Our study implies that the non-negligible entanglement between social media and macroeconomic behaviours can be insightful for policymaking in social-economic issues.",

    "data": "Massive content about user's social, personal and professional life stored on Online Social Networks (OSNs) has attracted not only the attention of researchers and social analysts but also the cyber criminals. These cyber criminals penetrate illegally into an OSN by establishing fake profiles or by designing bots and exploit the vulnerabilities of an OSN to carry out illegal activities. With the growth of technology cyber crimes have been increasing manifold. Daily reports of the security and privacy threats in the OSNs demand not only the intelligent automated detection systems that can identify and alleviate fake profiles in real time but also the reinforcement of the security and privacy laws to curtail the cyber crime. In this paper, we have studied various categories of fake profiles like compromised profiles, cloned profiles and online bots (spam-bots, social-bots, like-bots and influential-bots) on different OSN sites along with existing cyber laws to mitigate their threats. In order to design fake profile detection systems, we have highlighted different category of fake profile features which are capable to distinguish different kinds of fake entities from real ones. Another major challenges faced by researchers while building the fake profile detection systems is the unavailability of data specific to fake users. The paper addresses this challenge by providing extremely obliging data collection techniques along with some existing data sources. Furthermore, an attempt is made to present several machine learning techniques employed to design different fake profile detection systems.",

In this survey, we review user modeling strategies with respect to inferring user interests in previous studies. To this end, we focus on four dimensions of inferring user interest profiles: (1) data collection, (2) representation of user interest profiles, (3) construction and enhancement of user interest profiles, and (4) the evaluation of the constructed profiles.

In particular, we focus on the independent cascade model with the possibility of adaptively selecting seed nodes in multiple phases based on the observed diffusion in preceding phases, and conduct a detailed simulation study on real-world network datasets and various values of seeding budgets. We first present a negative result that more phases do not guarantee a better spread, however the adaptability advantage of more phases generally leads to a better spread in practice, as observed on real-world datasets. We study how diffusing in multiple phases affects the mean and standard deviation of the distribution representing the extent of diffusion. We then study how the number of phases impacts the effectiveness of multiphase diffusion, how the diffusion progresses phase-by-phase, and what is an optimal way to split the total seeding budget across phases. Our experiments suggest a significant gain when we move from single phase to two phases, and an appreciable gain when we further move to three phases, but the marginal gain thereafter is usually not very significant.

This motivates us to study the optimal coupon allocation problem, and our objective is to allocate coupons to a set of users so as to maximize the expected cascade. Different from existing studies on influence maximizaton (IM), our framework allows a general utility function and a more complex set of constraints. In particular, we formulate our problem as an approximate submodular maximization problem subject to matroid and knapsack constraints. Existing techniques relying on the submodularity of the utility function, such as greedy algorithm, can not work directly on a non-submodular function. We use $\\epsilon$ to measure the difference between our function and its closest submodular function and propose a novel approximate algorithm with approximation ratio $\\beta(\\epsilon)$ with $\\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0}\\beta(\\epsilon)=1-1/e$. This is the best approximation guarantee for approximate submodular maximization subject to a partition matroid and knapsack constraints, our results apply to a broad range of optimization problems that can be formulated as an approximate submodular maximization problem.",

Partnership between physicians can view as a fruitful work in most of the cases but sometimes this could be a problem for health insurance companies and patients, for example a recommendation to visit another physician only because they work in same clinic. The focus of the work is to better understand physicians activities and how these activities are represented in the data. Our approach considers three aspects: the relationships among physicians, the relationships between physicians and patients, and the relationships between physicians and health providers. We present the results of an analysis of a claims database (detailing 18 months of activity) from a large health insurance company in Brazil. The main contribution presented in this paper is a set of models to represent: mutual referral between physicians, patient retention, and physician centrality in the health insurance network. Our results show the proposed models based on social network frameworks, extracted surprising insights about physicians from real health insurance claims data.",

These applications could include the provision of social media-based training data for algorithms designed to forecast actual cyclone impacts or new socio-economic validation metrics for seasonal climate forecasts.",

An image uploaded to a social media site such as Flickr often has meaningful, associated information, such as comments and other images the user has uploaded, that is complementary to pixel content and helpful in predicting labels. Prediction challenges such as ImageNet~\\cite{imagenet_cvpr09} and MSCOCO~\\cite{LinMBHPRDZ:ECCV14} use only pixels, while other methods make predictions purely from social media context \\cite{McAuleyECCV12}. Our method is based on a novel fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework, where each node is an image, and consists of two deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and one Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that model both textual and visual node/image information. The edge weights of the CRF graph represent textual similarity and link-based metadata such as user sets and image groups. We model the CRF as an RNN for both learning and inference, and incorporate the weighted ranking loss and cross entropy loss into the CRF parameter optimization to handle the training data imbalance issue. Our proposed approach is evaluated on the MIR-9K dataset and experimentally outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches.",

This integration not only provides convenience for users to manage accounts of different OSNs, but also introduces usefulness to OSNs that adopt the cross-site linking function. In this paper, we investigate this usefulness based on users' data collected from a popular OSN called Medium.

We show that deep learning based models can overcome all three bottlenecks. Knowledge learned by these models on one dataset can be transferred to other datasets. We performed extensive experiments using three real-world datasets: Formspring (12k posts), Twitter (16k posts), and Wikipedia(100k posts).

    "data": "While social media offer great communication opportunities, they also increase the vulnerability of young people to threatening situations online. Recent studies report that cyberbullying constitutes a growing problem among youngsters. Successful prevention depends on the adequate detection of potentially harmful messages and the information overload on the Web requires intelligent systems to identify potential risks automatically. The focus of this paper is on automatic cyberbullying detection in social media text by modelling posts written by bullies, victims, and bystanders of online bullying. We describe the collection and fine-grained annotation of a training corpus for English and Dutch and perform a series of binary classification experiments to determine the feasibility of automatic cyberbullying detection. We make use of linear support vector machines exploiting a rich feature set and investigate which information sources contribute the most for this particular task. Experiments on a holdout test set reveal promising results for the detection of cyberbullying-related posts. After optimisation of the hyperparameters, the classifier yields an F1-score of 64% and 61% for English and Dutch respectively, and considerably outperforms baseline systems based on keywords and word unigrams.",

In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic network and text fetching with limited probing capacities, for identifying and maintaining influential users as the social network evolves.

We illustrate how the proposed solution maintains accurate PageRank scores for computing global influence, and topic-sensitive weighted PageRank scores for topic-based influence.

    "data": "This paper employs deep learning in detecting the traffic accident from social media data. First, we thoroughly investigate the 1-year over 3 million tweet contents in two metropolitan areas: Northern Virginia and New York City. Our results show that paired tokens can capture the association rules inherent in the accident-related tweets and further increase the accuracy of the traffic accident detection. Second, two deep learning methods: Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are investigated and implemented on the extracted token. Results show that DBN can obtain an overall accuracy of 85% with about 44 individual token features and 17 paired token features. The classification results from DBN outperform those of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and supervised Latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA). Finally, to validate this study, we compare the accident-related tweets with both the traffic accident log on freeways and traffic data on local roads from 15,000 loop detectors. It is found that nearly 66% of the accident-related tweets can be located by the accident log and more than 80% of them can be tied to nearby abnormal traffic data. Several important issues of using Twitter to detect traffic accidents have been brought up by the comparison including the location and time bias, as well as the characteristics of influential users and hashtags.",

    "data": "The rise of social media and online social networks has been a disruptive force in society. Opinions are increasingly shaped by interactions on online social media, and social phenomena including disagreement and polarization are now tightly woven into everyday life. In this work we initiate the study of the following question: given $n$ agents, each with its own initial opinion that reflects its core value on a topic, and an opinion dynamics model, what is the structure of a social network that minimizes {\\em polarization} and {\\em disagreement} simultaneously? This question is central to recommender systems: should a recommender system prefer a link suggestion between two online users with similar mindsets in order to keep disagreement low, or between two users with different opinions in order to expose each to the other's viewpoint of the world, and decrease overall levels of polarization? Our contributions include a mathematical formalization of this question as an optimization problem and an exact, time-efficient algorithm. We also prove that there always exists a network with $O(n/\\epsilon^2)$ edges that is a $(1+\\epsilon)$ approximation to the optimum. For a fixed graph, we additionally show how to optimize our objective function over the agents' innate opinions in polynomial time. We perform an empirical study of our proposed methods on synthetic and real-world data that verify their value as mining tools to better understand the trade-off between of disagreement and polarization. We find that there is a lot of space to reduce both polarization and disagreement in real-world networks; for instance, on a Reddit network where users exchange comments on politics, our methods achieve a $\\sim 60\\,000$-fold reduction in polarization and disagreement.",

Previous research, although achieves promising results, neglects one distinctive characteristic of social data, i.e., sequentiality. For example, the popularity of online content is generated over time with sequential post streams of social media. To investigate the sequential prediction of popularity, we propose a novel prediction framework called Deep Temporal Context Networks (DTCN) by incorporating both temporal context and temporal attention into account. Our DTCN contains three main components, from embedding, learning to predicting. With a joint embedding network, we obtain a unified deep representation of multi-modal user-post data in a common embedding space. Then, based on the embedded data sequence over time, temporal context learning attempts to recurrently learn two adaptive temporal contexts for sequential popularity. Finally, a novel temporal attention is designed to predict new popularity (the popularity of a new user-post pair) with temporal coherence across multiple time-scales. Experiments on our released image dataset with about 600K Flickr photos demonstrate that DTCN outperforms state-of-the-art deep prediction algorithms, with an average of 21.51% relative performance improvement in the popularity prediction (Spearman Ranking Correlation).",

Most studies use self-report data to quantify the connections between participants and construct social networks. In recent years smartphones have been used as an alternative to map networks by assessing the proximity between participants based on Bluetooth and GPS data. While most studies have handed out specially programmed smartphones to study participants, we developed an application for iOS and Android to collect Bluetooth data from participants own smartphones. In this study, we compared the networks estimated with the smartphone app to those obtained from sociometric badges and self-report data. Participants (n=21) installed the app on their phone and wore a sociometric badge during office hours. Proximity data was collected for 4 weeks. A contingency table revealed a significant association between proximity data (rho = 0.17, p<0.0001), but the marginal odds were higher for the app (8.6%) than for the badges (1.3%), indicating that dyads were more often detected by the app. We then compared the networks that were estimated using the proximity and self-report data. All three networks were significantly correlated, although the correlation with self-reported data was lower for the app (rho = 0.25) than for badges (rho = 0.67). The scanning rates of the app varied considerably between devices and was lower on iOS than on Android. The association between the app and the badges increased when the network was estimated between participants whose app recorded more regularly. These findings suggest that the accuracy of proximity networks can be further improved by reducing missing data and restricting the interpersonal distance at which interactions are detected.",

    "data": "Politicians all over the world are investing considerable time and effort in both creating and curating social media profiles, with many sending hundreds or even thousands of messages over social platforms during election time, often with the help of trained and professional staff. However, there have been only a handful of papers that have sought to test whether active campaigning on social media actually makes a positive difference to vote share outcomes. All of these studies are based on cross-sectional datasets from one election period that make separating true relationships from unobserved variables problematic. Hence empirical evidence on the actual impact of social media campaigning is thin. We analyse data from the first panel study of candidate social media use during elections, based on Twitter use in the 2015 and 2017 elections in the United Kingdom. We find support for the idea that Twitter based campaigning is associated with voting outcomes, a finding which is robust to a variety of different model specifications and a strong empirical test using a two wave panel design. Furthermore, we show that while the impact of Twitter use is small in absolute terms, it is nevertheless comparable with that of increased campaign spending, and could conceivably make a difference in a close electoral race. We use our results to advance theory around the impact of social media use on voter behaviour.",

In this formulation, the attacker has access to a noisy observation of the group membership of each user in the social network. When an unidentified victim visits a malicious website, the attacker uses browser history sniffing to make queries regarding the victim's social media activity. Particularly, it can make polar queries regarding the victim's group memberships and the victim's identity. The attacker receives noisy responses to her queries. The goal is to de-anonymize the victim with the minimum number of queries. Starting with a rigorous mathematical model for this active de-anonymization problem, an upper bound on the attacker's expected query cost is derived, and new attack algorithms are proposed which achieve this bound. These algorithms vary in computational cost and performance. The results suggest that prior heuristic approaches to this problem provide sub-optimal solutions.",

Many states experienced significant power outage, however many people used social media to communicate while having limited or no access to traditional information sources. In this study, we explored the evolution of various communication patterns using machine learning techniques and determined user concerns that emerged over the course of Hurricane Sandy. The original data included ~52M tweets coming from ~13M users between October 14, 2012 and November 12, 2012. We run topic model on ~763K tweets from top 4,029 most frequent users who tweeted about Sandy at least 100 times. We identified 250 well-defined communication patterns based on perplexity. Conversations of most frequent and relevant users indicate the evolution of numerous storm-phase (warning, response, and recovery) specific topics. People were also concerned about storm location and time, media coverage, and activities of political leaders and celebrities. We also present each relevant keyword that contributed to one particular pattern of user concerns. Such keywords would be particularly meaningful in targeted information spreading and effective crisis communication in similar major disasters. Each of these words can also be helpful for efficient hash-tagging to reach target audience as needed via social media. The pattern recognition approach of this study can be used in identifying real time user needs in future crises.",

According to DeGroot opinion formation model, one value of particular importance is the asymptotic consensus value---the sum of user opinions weighted by the users' eigenvector centralities. This value plays the role of an attractor for the opinions in the network and is a lucrative target for external influence. However, since any potentially malicious control of the opinion distribution in a social network is clearly undesirable, it is important to design methods to prevent the external attempts to strategically change the asymptotic consensus value. In this work, we assume that the adversary wants to maximize the asymptotic consensus value by altering the opinions of some users in a network; we, then, state DIVER---an NP-hard problem of disabling such external influence attempts by strategically adding a limited number of edges to the network. Relying on the theory of Markov chains, we provide perturbation analysis that shows how eigenvector centrality and, hence, DIVER's objective function change in response to an edge's addition to the network. The latter leads to the design of a pseudo-linear-time heuristic for DIVER, whose computation relies on efficient estimation of mean first passage times in a Markov chain. We confirm our theoretical findings in experiments.",

    "data": "We develop a novel visual model which can recognize protesters, describe their activities by visual attributes and estimate the level of perceived violence in an image. Studies of social media and protests use natural language processing to track how individuals use hashtags and links, often with a focus on those items' diffusion. These approaches, however, may not be effective in fully characterizing actual real-world protests (e.g., violent or peaceful) or estimating the demographics of participants (e.g., age, gender, and race) and their emotions. Our system characterizes protests along these dimensions. We have collected geotagged tweets and their images from 2013-2017 and analyzed multiple major protest events in that period. A multi-task convolutional neural network is employed in order to automatically classify the presence of protesters in an image and predict its visual attributes, perceived violence and exhibited emotions. We also release the UCLA Protest Image Dataset, our novel dataset of 40,764 images (11,659 protest images and hard negatives) with various annotations of visual attributes and sentiments. Using this dataset, we train our model and demonstrate its effectiveness. We also present experimental results from various analysis on geotagged image data in several prevalent protest events.

Although the viral marketing related problems in OSNs have been extensively studied in the past decade, the existing works all assume known propagation rates and are not able to solve the scenario when the rates may dynamically increase for popular topics. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Dynamic Influence Propagation (DIP), which allows propagation rates to change during the diffusion and can be used for describing information propagation in OSNs more realistically. Based on DIP, we define a new research problem: Threshold Activation Problem under DIP (TAP-DIP). TAP-DIP is more generalized than TAP and can be used for studying the DIP model. However, it adds another layer of complexity over the already \\#P-hard TAP problem. Despite it hardness, we are able to approximate TAP-DIP with $O(\\log|V|)$ ratio. Our solution consists of two major parts: 1) the Lipschitz optimization technique and 2) a novel solution to the general version of TAP, the Multi-TAP problem. We experimentally test our solution Using various real OSN datasets, and demonstrate that our solution not only generates high-quality yet much smaller seed sets when being aware of the rate increase, but also is scalable.

In this study, we have selected and implemented two approaches which are Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Social Network Recommendations System (SNRS).

Apart from recording the trajectory data, another major characteristic of these location-based services is that they also allow the users to connect whomever they like. A combination of social networking and location-based services is called as location-based social networks (LBSN). As shown in previous works, locations that are frequently visited by socially-related persons tend to be correlated, which indicates the close association between social connections and trajectory behaviors of users in LBSNs. In order to better analyze and mine LBSN data, we present a novel neural network model which can joint model both social networks and mobile trajectories. In specific, our model consists of two components: the construction of social networks and the generation of mobile trajectories. We first adopt a network embedding method for the construction of social networks: a networking representation can be derived for a user. The key of our model lies in the component of generating mobile trajectories. We have considered four factors that influence the generation process of mobile trajectories, namely user visit preference, influence of friends, short-term sequential contexts and long-term sequential contexts. To characterize the last two contexts, we employ the RNN and GRU models to capture the sequential relatedness in mobile trajectories at different levels, i.e., short term or long term. Finally, the two components are tied by sharing the user network representations. Experimental results on two important applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Especially, the improvement over baselines is more significant when either network structure or trajectory data is sparse.",

    "data": "This paper measures social media activity of 15 broad scientific disciplines indexed in Scopus database using Altmetric.com data. First, the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database is investigated, overall and across disciplines. Second, the correlation between the bibliometric and altmetric indices is examined using Spearman correlation. Third, a zero-truncated negative binomial model is used to determine the association of various factors with increasing or decreasing citations. Lastly, the effectiveness of altmetric indices to identify publications with high citation impact is comprehensively evaluated by deploying Area Under the Curve (AUC) - an application of receiver operating characteristic. Results indicate a rapid increase in the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database from 10.19% in 2011 to 20.46% in 2015. A zero-truncated negative binomial model is implemented to measure the extent to which different bibliometric and altmetric factors contribute to citation counts. Blog count appears to be the most important factor increasing the number of citations by 38.6% in the field of Health Professions and Nursing, followed by Twitter count increasing the number of citations by 8% in the field of Physics and Astronomy. Interestingly, both Blog count and Twitter count always show positive increase in the number of citations across all fields. While there was a positive weak correlation between bibliometric and altmetric indices, the results show that altmetric indices can be a good indicator to discriminate highly cited publications, with an encouragingly AUC= 0.725 between highly cited publications and total altmetric count. Overall, findings suggest that altmetrics could better distinguish highly cited publications.",

In this study, we analyze Twitter data to understand information spreading activities of social media users during hurricane Sandy. We create multiple subgraphs of Twitter users based on activity levels and analyze network properties of the subgraphs. We observe that user information sharing activity follows a power-law distribution suggesting the existence of few highly active nodes in disseminating information and many other nodes being less active. We also observe close enough connected components and isolates at all levels of activity, and networks become less transitive, but more assortative for larger subgraphs. We also analyze the association between user activities and characteristics that may influence user behavior to spread information during a crisis. Users become more active in spreading information if they are centrally placed in the network, less eccentric, and have higher degrees. Our analysis provides insights on how to exploit user characteristics and network properties to spread information or limit the spreading of misinformation during a crisis event.",

    "data": "An increasing number of social network mental disorders (SNMDs), such as Cyber-Relationship Addiction, Information Overload, and Net Compulsion, have been recently noted. Symptoms of these mental disorders are usually observed passively today, resulting in delayed clinical intervention. In this paper, we argue that mining online social behavior provides an opportunity to actively identify SNMDs at an early stage. It is challenging to detect SNMDs because the mental factors considered in standard diagnostic criteria (questionnaire) cannot be observed from online social activity logs. Our approach, new and innovative to the practice of SNMD detection, does not rely on self-revealing of those mental factors via questionnaires. Instead, we propose a machine learning framework, namely, Social Network Mental Disorder Detection (SNMDD), that exploits features extracted from social network data to accurately identify potential cases of SNMDs. We also exploit multi-source learning in SNMDD and propose a new SNMD-based Tensor Model (STM) to improve the performance. Our framework is evaluated via a user study with 3126 online social network users. We conduct a feature analysis, and also apply SNMDD on large-scale datasets and analyze the characteristics of the three SNMD types. The results show that SNMDD is promising for identifying online social network users with potential SNMDs.",

    "data": "Traces of user activities recorded in online social networks such as the creation, viewing and forwarding/sharing of information over time open new possibilities to quantitatively and systematically understand the information diffusion process on social networks. From an online social network like WeChat, we could collect a large number of information cascade trees, each of which tells the spreading trajectory of a message/information such as which user creates the information and which users view or forward the information shared by which neighbors. In this work, we propose two heterogeneous non-linear models. Both models are validated by the WeChat data in reproducing and explaining key features of cascade trees. Specifically, we firstly apply the Random Recursive Tree (RRT) to model the cascade tree topologies, capturing key features, i.e. the average path length and degree variance of a cascade tree in relation to the number of nodes (size) of the tree. The RRT model with a single parameter $\\theta$ describes the growth mechanism of a tree, where a node in the existing tree has a probability $d_i^{\\theta}$ of being connected to a newly added node that depends on the degree $d_i$ of the existing node. The identified parameter $\\theta$ quantifies the relative depth or broadness of the cascade trees, indicating that information propagates via a star-like broadcasting or viral-like hop by hop spreading. The RRT model explains the appearance of hubs, thus a possibly smaller average path length as the cascade size increases, as observed in WeChat. We further propose the stochastic Susceptible View Forward Removed (SVFR) model to depict the dynamic user behaviors including creating, viewing, forwarding and ignoring a message on a given social network.",

However, bias does not emerge from an algorithm alone. It is important to distinguish between the bias that arises from the data that serves as the input to the ranking system and the bias that arises from the ranking system itself. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify these distinct biases and apply this framework to politics-related queries on Twitter.

Such dynamics are especially notable during a period of crisis. This work addresses several important tasks of measuring, visualizing and predicting short term text representation shift, i.e. the change in a word's contextual semantics, and contrasting such shift with surface level word dynamics, or concept drift, observed in social media streams. Unlike previous approaches on learning word representations from text, we study the relationship between short-term concept drift and representation shift on a large social media corpus - VKontakte posts in Russian collected during the Russia-Ukraine crisis in 2014-2015. Our novel contributions include quantitative and qualitative approaches to (1) measure short-term representation shift and contrast it with surface level concept drift; (2) build predictive models to forecast short-term shifts in meaning from previous meaning as well as from concept drift; and (3) visualize short-term representation shift for example keywords to demonstrate the practical use of our approach to discover and track meaning of newly emerging terms in social media.

Under mild assumptions on the connectivity of the network, the social power of every individual converges to a constant strictly positive value as the number of issues discussed increases. \"If the network has a special topology, termed \"\"star topology\"\", then all social power accumulates with the individual at the centre of the star.\" This paper studies the strategic introduction of new individuals and/or interpersonal relationships into a social network with star topology to reduce the social power of the centre individual. In fact, several strategies are proposed. For each strategy, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the strength of the new interpersonal relationships, based on local information, which ensures that the centre individual no longer has the greatest social power within the social network. Interpretations of these conditions show that the strategies are remarkably intuitive and that certain strategies are favourable compared to others, all of which is sociologically expected.",

    "data": "In Group Activity Selection Problem (GASP), players form coalitions to participate in activities and have preferences over pairs of the form (activity, group size). Recently, Igarashi et al. have initiated the study of group activity selection problems on social networks (gGASP): a group of players can engage in the same activity if the members of the group form a connected subset of the underlying communication structure. Igarashi et al. have primarily focused on Nash stable outcomes, and showed that many associated algorithmic questions are computationally hard even for very simple networks. In this paper we study the parameterized complexity of gGASP with respect to the number of activities as well as with respect to the number of players, for several solution concepts such as Nash stability, individual stability and core stability. The first parameter we consider in the number of activities. For this parameter, we propose an FPT algorithm for Nash stability for the case where the social network is acyclic and obtain a W[1]-hardness result for cliques (i.e., for classic GASP); similar results hold for individual stability. In contrast, finding a core stable outcome is hard even if the number of activities is bounded by a small constant, both for classic GASP and when the social network is a star. Another parameter we study is the number of players. While all solution concepts we consider become polynomial-time computable when this parameter is bounded by a constant, we prove W[1]-hardness results for cliques (i.e., for classic GASP).",

Networks contain a set of strong, dominant communities, which interfere with the detection of weak, natural community structure. When most of the members of the weak communities also belong to stronger communities, they are extremely hard to be uncovered. We call the weak communities the hidden community structure. We present a novel approach called HICODE (HIdden COmmunity DEtection) that identifies the hidden community structure as well as the dominant community structure. By weakening the strength of the dominant structure, one can uncover the hidden structure beneath. Likewise, by reducing the strength of the hidden structure, one can more accurately identify the dominant structure. In this way, HICODE tackles both tasks simultaneously. Extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that HICODE outperforms several state-of-the-art community detection methods in uncovering both the dominant and the hidden structure. In the Facebook university social networks, we find multiple non-redundant sets of communities that are strongly associated with residential hall, year of registration or career position of the faculties or students, while the state-of-the-art algorithms mainly locate the dominant ground truth category. In the Due to the difficulty of labeling all ground truth communities in real-world datasets, HICODE provides a promising approach to pinpoint the existing latent communities and uncover communities for which there is no ground truth.

Our findings show that conspiracy content actually reverberates in a way which is hard to distinguish from the one scientific content does: for the classification mechanisms we investigated, classification F1-score never exceeds 0.65 during content propagation stages, and is still less than 0.7 even after propagation is complete.",

These environments serve as a common platform for heterogeneous users (e.g., corporate, individuals etc.) by hosting customized user applications and systems, providing ubiquitous access to the shared resources and requiring less administrative efforts; as a result, they enable users and companies to increase their productivity. Unfortunately, sharing of resources in open environments has significantly increased the privacy threats to the users. Indeed, shared electronic data may be exploited by third parties, such as Data Brokers, which may aggregate, infer and redistribute (sensitive) personal features, thus potentially impairing the privacy of the individuals. A way to palliate this problem consists on controlling the access of users over the potentially sensitive resources. Specifically, access control management regulates the access to the shared resources according to the credentials of the users, the type of resource and the privacy preferences of the resource/data owners.

One of the crucial problems in multi-layered social network analysis is community extraction. To cope with this problem the CLECC measure (Cross Layered Edge Clustering Coefficient) was proposed in the thesis. It is an edge measure which expresses how much the neighbors of two given users are similar each other. Based on this measure the CLECC algorithm for community extraction in the multi-layered social networks was designed. The algorithm was tested on the real single-layered social networks (SSN) and multi-layered social networks (MSN), as well as on benchmark networks from GN Benchmark (SSN), LFR Benchmark (SSN) and mLFR Benchmark (MSN) a special extension of LFR Benchmark, designed as a part of this thesis, which is able to produce multi-layered benchmark networks. The second research problem considered in the thesis was group evolution discovery. Studies on this problem have led to the development of the inclusion measure and the Group Evolution Discovery (GED) method, which is designed to identify events between two groups in successive time frames in the social network. The method was tested on a real social network and compared with two well-known algorithms regarding accuracy, execution time, flexibility and ease of implementation. Finally, a new approach to prediction of group evolution in the social network was developed. The new approach involves usage of the outputs of the GED method. It is shown, that using even a simple sequence, which consists of several preceding groups sizes and events, as an input for the classifier, the learned model can produce very good results also for simple classifiers.",

    "data": "Live online social broadcasting services like YouTube Live and Twitch have steadily gained popularity due to improved bandwidth, ease of generating content and the ability to earn revenue on the generated content. In contrast to traditional cable television, revenue in online services is generated solely through advertisements, and depends on the number of clicks generated. Channel owners aim to opportunistically schedule advertisements so as to generate maximum revenue. This paper considers the problem of optimal scheduling of advertisements in live online social media. The problem is formulated as a multiple stopping problem and is addressed in a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework. Structural results are provided on the optimal advertisement scheduling policy. By exploiting the structure of the optimal policy, best linear thresholds are computed using stochastic approximation. The proposed model and framework are validated on real datasets, and the following observations are made: (i) The policy obtained by the multiple stopping problem can be used to detect changes in ground truth from online search data (ii) Numerical results show a significant improvement in the expected revenue by opportunistically scheduling the advertisements. The revenue can be improved by $20-30\\%$ in comparison to currently employed periodic scheduling.",

    "data": "We consider a population of interconnected individuals that, with respect to a piece of information, at each time instant can be subdivided into three (time-dependent) categories: agnostics, influenced, and evangelists. A dynamical process of information diffusion evolves among the individuals of the population according to the following rules. Initially, all individuals are agnostic. Then, a set of people is chosen from the outside and convinced to start evangelizing, i.e., to start spreading the information. When a number of evangelists, greater than a given threshold, communicate with a node v, the node v becomes influenced, whereas, as soon as the individual v is contacted by a sufficiently much larger number of evangelists, it is itself converted into an evangelist and consequently it starts spreading the information. The question is: How to choose a bounded cardinality initial set of evangelists so as to maximize the final number of influenced individuals? We prove that the problem is hard to solve, even in an approximate sense. On the positive side, we present exact polynomial time algorithms for trees and complete graphs. For general graphs, we derive exact parameterized algorithms. We also investigate the problem when the objective is to select a minimum number of evangelists capable of influencing the whole network. Our motivations to study these problems come from the areas of Viral Marketing and the analysis of quantitative models of spreading of influence in social networks.",

    "data": "Breaking news leads to situations of fast-paced reporting in social media, producing all kinds of updates related to news stories, albeit with the caveat that some of those early updates tend to be rumours, i.e., information with an unverified status at the time of posting. Flagging information that is unverified can be helpful to avoid the spread of information that may turn out to be false. Detection of rumours can also feed a rumour tracking system that ultimately determines their veracity. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to rumour detection that learns from the sequential dynamics of reporting during breaking news in social media to detect rumours in new stories. Using Twitter datasets collected during five breaking news stories, we experiment with Conditional Random Fields as a sequential classifier that leverages context learnt during an event for rumour detection, which we compare with the state-of-the-art rumour detection system as well as other baselines. In contrast to existing work, our classifier does not need to observe tweets querying a piece of information to deem it a rumour, but instead we detect rumours from the tweet alone by exploiting context learnt during the event. Our classifier achieves competitive performance, beating the state-of-the-art classifier that relies on querying tweets with improved precision and recall, as well as outperforming our best baseline with nearly 40% improvement in terms of F1 score. The scale and diversity of our experiments reinforces the generalisability of our classifier.",

They facilitate exquisitely news sharing, knowledge elicitation, and forming groups of same interests. Researchers in the last two decades studied the growth dynamics of the online social networks extensively questing a clear understanding of the behavior of humans in online social networks that helps in many directions, like engineering better recommendation systems and attracting new members. However, not all of social networks achieved the desired growth, for example, online social networks like MySpace, Orkut, and Friendster are out of service today. In this work, we present a probabilistic theoretical model that captures the dynamics of the social decay due to the inactivity of the members of a social network. The model is proved to have some interesting mathematical properties, namely \\textit{submodularity}, which imply achieving the model optimization in a reasonable performance. That means the maximization problem can be approximated within a factor of $(1-1/e)$ and the minimization problem can be achieved in polynomial time.",

This results in the need for first responders to inspect the spread of such images and users propagating them on social media. In this paper, we present a comparison between different hand-crafted features and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to retrieve similar images, which outperforms state-of-art hand-crafted features. We propose an Open-Source-Intelligent (OSINT) real-time image search system, robust to retrieve modified images that allows first responders to analyze the current spread of images, sentiments floating and details of users propagating such content. The system also aids officials to save time of manually analyzing the content by reducing the search space on an average by 67%.",

It tells people where activities and locations that interest them are and it allows them to share their urban experiences and self-representations. Therefore, any analysis of urban structures and cultures needs to consider social media activity. In our paper, we introduce the novel concept of social media inequality. This concept allows us to quantitatively compare patterns in social media activities between parts of a city, a number of cities, or any other spatial areas. We define this concept using an analogy with the concept of economic inequality. Economic inequality indicates how some economic characteristics or material resources, such as income, wealth or consumption are distributed in a city, country or between countries. Accordingly, we can define social media inequality as the measure of the distribution of characteristics from social media content shared in a particular geographic area or between areas. An example of such characteristics is the number of photos shared by all users of a social network such as Instagram in a given city or city area, or the content of these photos.

    "data": "For a broad range of research, governmental and commercial applications it is important to understand the allegiances, communities and structure of key players in society. One promising direction towards extracting this information is to exploit the rich relational data in digital social networks (the social graph). As social media data sets are very large, most approaches make use of distributed computing systems for this purpose. Distributing graph processing requires solving many difficult engineering problems, which has lead some researchers to look at single-machine solutions that are faster and easier to maintain. In this article, we present a single-machine real-time system for large-scale graph processing that allows analysts to interactively explore graph structures. The key idea is that the aggregate actions of large numbers of users can be compressed into a data structure that encapsulates user similarities while being robust to noise and queryable in real-time. We achieve single machine real-time performance by compressing the neighbourhood of each vertex using minhash signatures and facilitate rapid queries through Locality Sensitive Hashing. These techniques reduce query times from hours using industrial desktop machines operating on the full graph to milliseconds on standard laptops. Our method allows exploration of strongly associated regions (i.e. communities) of large graphs in real-time on a laptop. It has been deployed in software that is actively used by social network analysts and offers another channel for media owners to monetise their data, helping them to continue to provide free services that are valued by billions of people globally.",

    "data": "We present a dictionary-based approach to racism detection in Dutch social media comments, which were retrieved from two public Belgian social media sites likely to attract racist reactions. These comments were labeled as racist or non-racist by multiple annotators. For our approach, three discourse dictionaries were created: first, we created a dictionary by retrieving possibly racist and more neutral terms from the training data, and then augmenting these with more general words to remove some bias. A second dictionary was created through automatic expansion using a \\texttt{word2vec} model trained on a large corpus of general Dutch text. Finally, a third dictionary was created by manually filtering out incorrect expansions. We trained multiple Support Vector Machines, using the distribution of words over the different categories in the dictionaries as features. The best-performing model used the manually cleaned dictionary and obtained an F-score of 0.46 for the racist class on a test set consisting of unseen Dutch comments, retrieved from the same sites used for the training set. The automated expansion of the dictionary only slightly boosted the model's performance, and this increase in performance was not statistically significant. The fact that the coverage of the expanded dictionaries did increase indicates that the words that were automatically added did occur in the corpus, but were not able to meaningfully impact performance. The dictionaries, code, and the procedure for requesting the corpus are available at: https://github.com/clips/hades",

When integrated over time, these estimations are called quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Until now, characterizing health utilities (HUs) required detailed patient interviews or written surveys. While reliable and specific, this data remained costly due to efforts to locate, enlist and coordinate participants. Thus the scope, context and temporality of diseases examined has remained limited. Now that more than a billion people use social media, we propose a novel strategy: use natural language processing to analyze public online conversations for signals of the severity of medical conditions and correlate these to known HUs using machine learning. In this work, we filter a dataset that originally contained 2 billion tweets for relevant content on 60 diseases. Using this data, our algorithm successfully distinguished mild from severe diseases, which had previously been categorized only by traditional techniques. This represents progress towards two related applications: first, predicting HUs where such information is nonexistent; and second, (where rich HU data already exists) estimating temporal or geographic patterns of disease severity through data mining.",

New tools continue to be developed and used to analyse our personal connections, with particular emphasis on detecting communities or identifying key individuals in a social network. This raises privacy concerns that are likely to exacerbate in the future. With this in mind, we ask the question: Can individuals or groups actively manage their connections to evade social network analysis tools? By addressing this question, the general public may better protect their privacy, oppressed activist groups may better conceal their existence, and security agencies may better understand how terrorists escape detection. \"We first study how an individual can evade \"\"network centrality\"\" analysis without compromising his or her influence within the network.\" We prove that an optimal solution to this problem is hard to compute.

This works contributes to the understanding of privacy implications of such data sharing by analysing how well people are recognisable in social media data. To facilitate a systematic study we define a number of scenarios considering factors such as how many heads of a person are tagged and if those heads are obfuscated or not. We propose a robust person recognition system that can handle large variations in pose and clothing, and can be trained with few training samples. Our results indicate that a handful of images is enough to threaten users' privacy, even in the presence of obfuscation. We show detailed experimental results, and discuss their implications.",

    "data": "In online social networks (OSN), users quite usually disclose sensitive information about themselves by publishing messages. At the same time, they are (in many cases) unable to properly manage the access to this sensitive information due to the following issues: i) the rigidness of the access control mechanism implemented by the OSN, and ii) many users lack of technical knowledge about data privacy and access control. To tackle these limitations, in this paper, we propose a dynamic, transparent and privacy-driven access control mechanism for textual messages published in OSNs. The notion of privacy-driven is achieved by analyzing the semantics of the messages to be published and, according to that, assessing the degree of sensitiveness of their contents. For this purpose, the proposed system relies on an automatic semantic annotation mechanism that, by using knowledge bases and linguistic tools, is able to associate a meaning to the information to be published. By means of this annotation, our mechanism automatically detects the information that is sensitive according to the privacy requirements of the publisher of data, with regard to the type of reader that may access such data. Finally, our access control mechanism automatically creates sanitized versions of the users' publications according to the type of reader that accesses them. As a result, our proposal, which can be integrated in already existing social networks, provides an automatic, seamless and content-driven protection of user publications, which are coherent with her privacy requirements and the type of readers that access them. Complementary to the system design, we also discuss the feasibility of the system by illustrating it through a real example and evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness over standard approaches.",

    "data": "Recently in Online Social Networks (OSNs), the Least Cost Influence (LCI) problem has become one of the central research topics. It aims at identifying a minimum number of seed users who can trigger a wide cascade of information propagation. Most of existing literature investigated the LCI problem only based on an individual network. However, nowadays users often join several OSNs such that information could be spread across different networks simultaneously. Therefore, in order to obtain the best set of seed users, it is crucial to consider the role of overlapping users under this circumstances. In this article, we propose a unified framework to represent and analyze the influence diffusion in multiplex networks. More specifically, we tackle the LCI problem by mapping a set of networks into a single one via lossless and lossy coupling schemes. The lossless coupling scheme preserves all properties of original networks to achieve high quality solutions, while the lossy coupling scheme offers an attractive alternative when the running time and memory consumption are of primary concern. Various experiments conducted on both real and synthesized datasets have validated the effectiveness of the coupling schemes, which also provide some interesting insights into the process of influence propagation in multiplex networks.",

To enrich this effort, and by capitalizing on ideas from the social network analysis domain, we build a tool that can help classify malware families using features driven from the graph structure of their system calls. To achieve that, we first construct a system call graph that consists of system calls found in the execution of the individual malware families. To explore distinguishing features of various malware species, we study social network properties as applied to the call graph, including the degree distribution, degree centrality, average distance, clustering coefficient, network density, and component ratio. We utilize features driven from those properties to build a classifier for malware families. Our experimental results show that influence-based graph metrics such as the degree centrality are effective for classifying malware, whereas the general structural metrics of malware are less effective for classifying malware. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system performs well in detecting and classifying malware families within each malware class with accuracy greater than 96%.",

The agents of the network have to decide whether to undertake a certain action or not. They make their decision by comparing the activity level of their neighbors with a time-varying threshold, evolving according to a time-invariant opinion dynamic model. Key features of the model are a parameter representing the degree of self-confidence of the agents, and the mechanism adopted by the agents to evaluate the activity level of their neighbors. The case in which a radical agent, initially eager to undertake the action, interacts with a group of ordinary agents, is considered. The main contribution of the paper is the complete analytic characterization of the asymptotic behaviors of the network, for three different graph topologies. The asymptotic activity patterns are determined as a function of the self-confidence parameter and of the initial threshold of the ordinary agents.",

It is challenging to figure out the formation mechanism of such a Social-InterestCast, since it involves multiple interrelated factors such as users' social relationships, users' interests, and content semantics. We propose a four-layered system model, consisting of physical layer, social layer, content layer, and session layer.

A disadvantage of this setting is that the marketer is forced to select all the seeds based solely on a diffusion model. If some of the selected seeds do not perform well, there is no opportunity to course-correct. A more practical setting is the adaptive setting in which the marketer initially selects a batch of users and observes how well seeding those users leads to a diffusion of product adoptions. Based on this market feedback, she formulates a policy for choosing the remaining seeds. In this paper, we study adaptive offline strategies for two problems: (a) MAXSPREAD -- given a budget on number of seeds and a time horizon, maximize the spread of influence and (b) MINTSS -- given a time horizon and an expected number of target users to be influenced, minimize the number of seeds that will be required. In particular, we present theoretical bounds and empirical results for an adaptive strategy and quantify its practical benefit over the non-adaptive strategy. We evaluate adaptive and non-adaptive policies on three real data sets. We conclude that while benefit of going adaptive for the MAXSPREAD problem is modest, adaptive policies lead to significant savings for the MINTSS problem.",

Under it's influece popular items get more popular thereby resulting in long tailed distribution problem. Consequently, new items which can be popular (potential ones), are suppressed by the already popular items. This paper proposes a novel model which is able to identify potential items. It identifies the potentially popular items by considering the number of links or ratings it has recieved in recent past along with it's popularity decay. For obtaining an effecient model we consider only temporal features of the content, avoiding the cost of extracting other features. We have found that people follow recent behaviours of their peers. In presence of fit or quality items already popular items lose it's popularity. Prediction accuracy is measured on three industrial datasets namely Movielens, Netflix and Facebook wall post. Experimental results show that compare to state-of-the-art model our model have better prediction accuracy.",

We develop a framework for analyzing the population of users who participate in trending topics over the course of these topics' lifecycles. \"Central to our analysis is the notion of a \"\"status gradient\"\", describing how users of different activity levels adopt a trend at different points in time.\" Across multiple datasets, we find that this methodology reveals key differences in the nature of the early adopters in different domains.",

Of these Quantified Selfs many choose to openly share their data via online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. In this study, we use data for users who have chosen to connect their smart scales to Twitter, providing both a reliable time series of their body weight, as well as insights into their social surroundings and general online behavior. Concretely, we look at which social media features are predictive of physical status, such as body weight at the individual level, and activity patterns at the population level. We show that it is possible to predict an individual's weight using their online social behaviors, such as their self-description and tweets. Weekly and monthly patterns of quantified-self behaviors are also discovered. These findings could contribute to building models to monitor public health and to have more customized personal training interventions. While there are many studies using either quantified self or social media data in isolation, this is one of the few that combines the two data sources and, to the best of our knowledge, the only one that uses public data.",

Consequently it is often useful to understand how an attempt to influence a network will change its structure and consequently achieve other goals. We develop a framework for network modification that allows for arbitrary objective functions, types of modification (e.g. edge weight addition, edge weight removal, node removal, and covariate value change), and recovery mechanisms (i.e. how a network responds to interventions). The framework outlined in this paper helps both to situate the existing work on network interventions but also opens up many new possibilities for intervening in networks. In particular use two case studies to highlight the potential impact of empirically calibrating the objective function and network recovery mechanisms as well as showing how interventions beyond node removal can be optimised. First, we simulate an optimal removal of nodes from the Noordin terrorist network in order to reduce the expected number of attacks (based on empirically predicting the terrorist collaboration network from multiple types of network ties). Second, we simulate optimally strengthening ties within entrepreneurial ecosystems in six developing countries.

The generalized friendship paradox is an extension to attributes other than the number of friends. The friendship paradox and its generalized version have gathered recent attention due to the information they provide about network structure and local inequalities. In this paper, we propose several measures of nodal qualities which capture different aspects of their activities and influence in online social networks. Using these measures we analyse the prevalence of the generalized friendship paradox over Twitter and we report high levels of prevalence (up to over 90\\% of nodes). We contend that this prevalence of the friendship paradox and its generalized version arise because of the hierarchical nature of the connections in the network. This hierarchy is nested as opposed to being star-like. We conclude that these paradoxes are collective phenomena not created merely by a minority of well-connected or high-attribute nodes. Moreover, our results show that a large fraction of individuals can experience the generalized friendship paradox even in the absence of a significant correlation between degrees and attributes.",

Therefore, various personalized recommendation systems have been proposed. However, they ignore that the accelerated proliferation of social media data has led to the big data era, which has greatly impeded the process of video recommendation. In addition, none of them has considered both the privacy of users' contexts (e,g., social status, ages and hobbies) and video service vendors' repositories, which are extremely sensitive and of significant commercial value. To handle the problems, we propose a cloud-assisted differentially private video recommendation system based on distributed online learning. In our framework, service vendors are modeled as distributed cooperative learners, recommending videos according to user's context, while simultaneously adapting the video-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks (reward). Considering the sparsity and heterogeneity of big social media data, we also propose a novel geometric differentially private model, which can greatly reduce the performance (recommendation accuracy) loss. Our simulation shows the proposed algorithms outperform other existing methods and keep a delicate balance between computing accuracy and privacy preserving level.",

Information diffusion is modeled as a Susceptible-Infected epidemic and direct recruitment of susceptible nodes to the infected (informed) class is used as a strategy to accelerate the spread of information. We formulate an optimal control problem for optimizing a net reward function, a linear combination of the reward due to information spread and cost due to application of controls. The time varying resource allocation and seeds for the epidemic are jointly optimized. A problem variation includes a fixed budget constraint. We prove the existence of a solution for the optimal control problem, provide conditions for uniqueness of the solution, and prove some structural results for the controls (e.g. controls are non-increasing functions of time). The solution technique uses Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and the forward-backward sweep algorithm (and its modifications) for numerical computations. Our formulations lead to large optimality systems with up to about 200 differential equations and allow us to study the effect of network topology (Erdos-Renyi/scale-free) on the controls. Results reveal that the allocation of campaigning resources to various degree classes depends not only on the network topology but also on system parameters such as cost/abundance of resources. The optimal strategies lead to significant gains over heuristic strategies for various model parameters. Our modeling approach assumes uncorrelated network, however, we find the approach useful for real networks as well. This work is useful in product advertising, political and crowdfunding campaigns in social networks.",

In this paper, we argue that while emoticons are strong and common signals of sentiment expression on social media the relationship between emoticons and sentiment polarity are not always clear. Thus, any algorithm that deals with sentiment polarity should take emoticons into account but extreme cau- tion should be exercised in which emoticons to depend on. First, to demonstrate the prevalence of emoticons on social media, we analyzed the frequency of emoticons in a large re- cent Twitter data set. Then we carried out four analyses to examine the relationship between emoticons and sentiment polarity as well as the contexts in which emoticons are used. The first analysis surveyed a group of participants for their perceived sentiment polarity of the most frequent emoticons. The second analysis examined clustering of words and emoti- cons to better understand the meaning conveyed by the emoti- cons. The third analysis compared the sentiment polarity of microblog posts before and after emoticons were removed from the text. The last analysis tested the hypothesis that removing emoticons from text hurts sentiment classification by training two machine learning models with and without emoticons in the text respectively. The results confirms the arguments that: 1) a few emoticons are strong and reliable signals of sentiment polarity and one should take advantage of them in any senti- ment analysis; 2) a large group of the emoticons conveys com- plicated sentiment hence they should be treated with extreme caution.",

The introduction of a new SNS with a better set of features can lead to the demise of an existing SNS, as observed in the transition from Orkut to Facebook. The paper proposes a model for analyzing the transition of users from one SNS to another, when a new SNS is introduced in the system. The game theoretic model proposed considers two major factors in determining the success of a new SNS. The first being time that an old SNS gets to stabilise. We study whether the time that a SNS like Facebook received to monopolize its reach had a distinguishable effect. The second factor is the set of features showcased by the new SNS.

A rich body of these studies is related to influence maximization, which aims to select a set of seed nodes for maximizing the expected number of active nodes at the end of the process. However, the set of active nodes can not fully represent the true coverage of information propagation. A node may be informed of the information when any of its neighbours become active and try to activate it, though this node (namely informed node) is still inactive. Therefore, we need to consider both active nodes and informed nodes that are aware of the information when we study the coverage of information propagation in a network. Along this line, in this paper we propose a new problem called Information Coverage Maximization that aims to maximize the expected number of both active nodes and informed ones. After we prove that this problem is NP-hard and submodular in the independent cascade model and the linear threshold model, we design two algorithms to solve it.

This paper addresses the problem of locating the source of a rumor in large social networks where some of these sensor nodes have failed. We estimate the missing information about the sensors using doubly non-negative (DN) matrix completion and compressed sensing techniques. This is then used to identify the actual source by using a maximum likelihood estimator we developed earlier, on a large data set from Sina Weibo. Results indicate that the estimation techniques result in almost as good a performance of the ML estimator as for the network for which complete information is available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work on source identification with incomplete information in social networks.",

    "data": "Many societies are organized in networks that are formed by people who meet and interact over time. In this paper, we present a first model to capture the micro-foundations of social networks evolution, where boundedly rational agents of different types join the network; meet other agents stochastically over time; and consequently decide to form social ties. A basic premise of our model is that in real-world networks, agents form links by reasoning about the benefits that agents they meet over time can bestow. We study the evolution of the emerging networks in terms of friendship and popularity acquisition given the following exogenous parameters: structural opportunism, type distribution, homophily, and social gregariousness. \"We show that the time needed for an agent to find \"\"friends\"\" is influenced by the exogenous parameters: agents who are more gregarious, more homophilic, less opportunistic, or belong to a type \"\"minority\"\" spend a longer time on average searching for friendships.\" Moreover, we show that preferential attachment is a consequence of an emerging doubly preferential meeting process: a process that guides agents of a certain type to meet more popular similar-type agents with a higher probability, thereby creating asymmetries in the popularity evolution of different types of agents.",

After analyzing six stories in a 30-hour time span, we found out that the lifetime of a story's popularity among the members of the social network has three phases: Expansion, Front-page, and Saturation. Expansion phase starts when a story is published and the article spreads from a source node to nodes within a connected component of the social network.

In this paper, we consider time-critical influence maximization, in which one wants to maximize influence spread within a given deadline. Since timing is considered in the optimization, we also extend the Independent Cascade (IC) model and the Linear Threshold (LT) model to incorporate the time delay aspect of influence diffusion among individuals in social networks. We show that time-critical influence maximization under the time-delayed IC and LT models maintains desired properties such as submodularity, which allows a greedy approximation algorithm to achieve an approximation ratio of $1-1/e$. To overcome the inefficiency of the greedy algorithm, we design two heuristic algorithms: the first one is based on a dynamic programming procedure that computes exact influence in tree structures and directed acyclic subgraphs, while the second one converts the problem to one in the original models and then applies existing fast heuristic algorithms to it. Our simulation results demonstrate that our algorithms achieve the same level of influence spread as the greedy algorithm while running a few orders of magnitude faster, and they also outperform existing fast heuristics that disregard the deadline constraint and delays in diffusion.",

    "data": "Online social networking (OSN) has become of great influence to Filipinos, where Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, and Instagram are among the popular ones. Their popularity, coupled with their intuitive and interactive use, allow one's personal information such as gender, age, address, relationship status, and list of friends to become publicly available. The accessibility of information from these sites allow, with the aid of computers, for the study of a wide population's characteristics even in a provincial scale. Aside from being neighbouring locales, the respective residents of Laguna and Batangas both derive their livelihoods from two lakes, Laguna de Bay and Taal Lake. Both residents experience similar problems, such as that, among many others, of fish kill. The goal of this research is to find out similarities in their respective online populations, particularly that of Facebook's. With the use of computational dynamic social network analysis (CDSNA), we found out that the two communities are similar, among others, as follows:   o Both populations are dominated by single young female   o Homophily was observed when choosing a friend in terms of age (i.e., friendships were created more often between people whose ages do not differ by at most five years); and   o Heterophily was observed when choosing friends in terms of gender (i.e., more friendships were created between a male and a female than between both people of the same gender). This paper also presents the differences in the structure of the two social networks, such as degrees of separation and preferential attachment.",

The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based micro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the emotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook hypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues typical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to adopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social network. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they require massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the individuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional contagion using Twitter. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null model that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of emotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are exposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a negative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than baseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50% more positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship between the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and that of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of individuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly susceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions than the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive emotions. In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much greater than that of negative emotions.",

    "data": "For many users on social networks, one of the goals when broadcasting content is to reach a large audience. The probability of receiving reactions to a message differs for each user and depends on various factors, such as location, daily and weekly behavior patterns and the visibility of the message. While previous work has focused on overall network dynamics and message flow cascades, the problem of recommending personalized posting times has remained an underexplored topic of research. In this study, we formulate a when-to-post problem, where the objective is to find the best times for a user to post on social networks in order to maximize the probability of audience responses. To understand the complexity of the problem, we examine user behavior in terms of post-to-reaction times, and compare cross-network and cross-city weekly reaction behavior for users in different cities, on both Twitter and Facebook. We perform this analysis on over a billion posted messages and observed reactions, and propose multiple approaches for generating personalized posting schedules. We empirically assess these schedules on a sampled user set of 0.5 million active users and more than 25 million messages observed over a 56 day period. We show that users see a reaction gain of up to 17% on Facebook and 4% on Twitter when the recommended posting times are used. We open the dataset used in this study, which includes timestamps for over 144 million posts and over 1.1 billion reactions. The personalized schedules derived here are used in a fully deployed production system to recommend posting times for millions of users every day.",

However, this paradigm requires large-scale category labels, which limits its applicability to domains where labels are hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven feature learning paradigm which does not rely on category labels. Instead, we learn from user behavior data collected on social media. Concretely, we use the image relationship discovered in the latent space from the user behavior data to guide the image feature learning. We collect a large-scale image and user behavior dataset from Behance.net. The dataset consists of 1.9 million images and over 300 million view records from 1.9 million users. We validate our feature learning paradigm on this dataset and find that the learned feature significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art image features in learning better image similarities.

We apply this model to the problem of inducing the social function of address terms, such as 'Madame', 'comrade', and 'dude'. On a dataset of movie scripts, our system obtains a coherent clustering of address terms, while at the same time making intuitively plausible judgments of the formality of social relations in each film. As an additional contribution, we provide a bootstrapping technique for identifying and tagging address terms in dialogue.",
