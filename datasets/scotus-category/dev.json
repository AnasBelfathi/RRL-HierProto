    "data": "\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court. In this case, which arises under our original jurisdiction,\nU. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C. §1251(a), we\nconsider nine exceptions submitted by the parties to two\nreports filed by the Special Master. \n   In 1986, Congress granted its consent under the Com­\npact Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §10, cl. 3, to seven inter­\nstate compacts providing for the creation of regional facili­\nties to dispose of low-level radioactive waste. Omnibus\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste Interstate Compact Consent\nAct, 99 Stat. 1859. One of those compacts was the South­\neast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management\nCompact (Compact), entered into by Alabama, Florida,\nGeorgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina,\nTennessee, and Virginia. Id., at 1871–1880. That Com­\npact established an “instrument and framework for a\ncooperative effort” to develop new facilities for the long­\nterm disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated\nwithin the region. Art. 1, id., at 1872. The Compact was\nto be administered by a Southeast Interstate Low-Level\nRadioactive Waste Management Commission (Commis­\nsion), composed of two voting members from each party\nState. Art. 4(A), id., at 1874.\n \n   A pre-existing facility in Barnwell, South Carolina was\nto serve as the initial facility for regional generators to\ndispose of their low-level radioactive waste. Art. 2(10), id.,\nat 1873. That facility was scheduled to close as the re­\ngional-disposal facility for the Compact by the end of 1992,\nibid., and so the Compact required the Commission to\ndevelop “procedures and criteria for identifying . . . a host\n[S]tate for the development of a second regional disposal\nfacility,” and to “seek to ensure that such facility is li­\ncensed and ready to operate as soon as required but in no\nevent later than 1991,” Art. 4(E)(6), id., at 1875. The\nCompact authorized the Commission to “designate” a\nparty State as a host State for the facility. Art. 4(E)(7),\nibid. \n   In September 1986, the Commission designated North\nCarolina as the host for the second facility. North Caro­\nlina therefore became obligated to “take appropriate steps\nto ensure that an application for a license to construct and\noperate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is\nfiled with and issued by the appropriate authority.” Art.\n5(C), id., at 1877. In 1987, North Carolina’s General\nAssembly created the North Carolina Low-Level Radioac­\ntive Waste Management Authority (Authority) to fulfill\nthe State’s obligation. N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G (1987), 1987\nN. C. Sess. Laws ch. 850. \n   Although “[t]he Commission is not responsible for any\ncosts associated with,” among other things, “the creation of\nany facility,” Art. 4(K)(1), 99 Stat. 1876, North Carolina\nasked the Commission for financial assistance with build­\ning and licensing costs. The Commission responded by\nadopting a resolution, which declared it was both “appro­\npriate and necessary” for the Commission “to provide\nfinancial assistance” to North Carolina. App. 63. To that\nend, the Commission created a “Host States Assistance\nFund” to help North Carolina with the “financial costs and\nburdens” of “preliminary planning, the administrative\npreparation, and other pre-operational” activities. Id., at\n64.\n \n   The estimate in 1989 was that it would cost approxi­\nmately $21 million and take two years to obtain a license\nfor North Carolina’s regional-disposal facility. That\nproved to be wildly optimistic. By 1990, the cost estimate\nhad ballooned to $45.8 million, and the estimated date for\nobtaining a license now extended far into 1993. At the\nbeginning of 1994 there still was no license, and the esti­\nmated cost had grown to $87.1 million. By end of 1994 the\nestimate was $112.5 million, and issuance of a license was\nnot anticipated until 1997. And by December 1996 the\nestimated cost had increased by another $27 million and\nthe projected date to receive a license had become August\n2000.\n \n   North Carolina’s own appropriations—approximately\n$27 million from Fiscal Year 1988 through Fiscal Year\n(FY) 1995—did not cover the costs of the licensing phase. But during the same time period, the Commission pro­\nvided North Carolina with approximately $67 million. The funds came from surcharges and access fees collected\nfor that purpose from generators disposing of low-level\nradioactive waste at the pre-existing Barnwell facility. Id., at 71–74, 145.\n \n   In July 1995, however, South Carolina withdrew from\nthe Compact, thereby depriving the Commission of contin­\nued revenues from the Barnwell facility. In 1996, the\nCommission accordingly informed North Carolina that it\nwould no longer be able to provide financial support for\nlicensing activities. The Governor of North Carolina\nresponded that the State was not prepared to assume a\ngreater portion of the project’s costs, and would not be able\nto proceed without continued Commission funding. Shortly thereafter the Commission adopted a resolution\ndeclaring that it was willing and able to provide additional\nfunds, but calling on North Carolina to work with it to\ndevelop long-term funding sources for the facility. From\nFY 1996 through FY 1998, the Commission provided\nNorth Carolina approximately an additional $12.27 mil­\nlion in financial assistance. North Carolina, for its part,\ncontinued to provide its own funds toward licensing activi­\nties—another $6 million during the same time period. \n   In August 1997, the Commission notified North Caro­\nlina that absent a plan for funding the remaining steps of\nthe licensing phase, it would not disburse additional funds\nto North Carolina after November 30, 1997. North Caro­\nlina responded that it would not be able to continue with­\nout additional guarantees of external funding. On Decem­\nber 1, 1997, the parties having failed to agree upon a long­\nterm financing plan, the Commission ceased financial\nassistance to North Carolina. By then it had provided\nalmost $80 million. \n   On December 19, 1997, North Carolina informed the\nCommission it would commence an orderly shutdown of its\nlicensing project, and since that date has taken no further\nsteps toward obtaining a license for the facility. But it did\ncontinue to fund the Authority for several more years, in\nthe hope that the project would resume upon the restora­\ntion of external financial assistance. North Carolina\nmaintained the proposed facility site, preserved the work\nit had completed to date, and retained the Authority’s\nbooks and records. It also participated in discussions with\nthe Commission, generators of low-level radioactive waste,\nand other stakeholders regarding options to resolve the\nfinancing shortfall. From FY 1988 through FY 2000,\nNorth Carolina had expended almost $34 million toward\nobtaining a license. \n   In June 1999, after attempts to resolve the funding\nimpasse had failed, Florida and Tennessee filed with the\nCommission a complaint for sanctions against North\nCarolina. It alleged that North Carolina had failed to\nfulfill its obligations under the Compact, and requested\n(among other things) return of the almost $80 million paid\nto North Carolina by the Commission, plus interest, as\nwell as damages and attorney’s fees. The next month,\nNorth Carolina withdrew from the Compact by enacting a\nlaw repealing its status as a party State, see 1999 N. C.\nSess. Laws ch. 357, as required by Article 7(G) of the\nCompact. \n   More than four months later, in December 1999, the\nCommission held a sanctions hearing. North Carolina did\nnot participate. After the hearing, the Commission con­\ncluded that North Carolina had failed to fulfill its obliga­\ntions under the Compact. It adopted a resolution demand­\ning that North Carolina repay approximately $80 million,\nplus interest, to the Commission; pay an additional $10\nmillion penalty to compensate the Commission for the loss\nof future revenue (surcharges and access fees) it would\nhave received had a facility been completed in North\nCarolina; and pay the Commission’s attorney’s fees. North\nCarolina did not comply. \n   In July 2000, seeking to enforce its sanctions resolution,\nthe Commission moved for leave to file a bill of complaint\nunder our original jurisdiction. Southeast Interstate LowLevel Radioactive Waste Management Commission v.\nNorth Carolina, No. 131, Orig. North Carolina opposed\nthe motion on the grounds that the Commission could not\ninvoke this Court’s original jurisdiction, and we invited\nthe Solicitor General to express the views of the United\nStates. 531 U. S. 942 (2000). The Solicitor General filed a\nbrief urging denial of the Commission’s motion on the\ngrounds that the Commission’s bill of complaint did not\nfall within our exclusive original jurisdiction over “contro­\nversies between two or more States.” §1251(a). We denied\nthe Commission’s motion. 533 U. S. 926 (2001).\n \n   In June 2002, the States of Alabama, Florida, Tennes­\nsee, and Virginia, joined by the Commission (collectively\nPlaintiffs), moved for leave to file a bill of complaint\nagainst North Carolina. North Carolina opposed the\nmotion, and we again sought the views of the Solicitor\nGeneral. 537 U. S. 806 (2002). The United States urged\nthat we grant Plaintiffs’ motion, which we did. 539 U. S.\n925 (2003). The bill of complaint contains five counts: violation of the party States’ rights under the Compact\n(Count I); breach of contract (Count II); unjust enrichment\n(Count III), promissory estoppel (Count IV); and money\nhad and received (Count V). Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief\nrequests a declaration that North Carolina is subject to\nsanctions and that the Commission’s sanctions resolution\nis valid and enforceable, as well as the award of damages,\ncosts, and other relief. \n   We assigned the case to a Special Master, 540 U. S.\n1014 (2003), who has conducted proceedings and now has\nfiled two reports. The Master’s Preliminary Report ad­\ndressed three motions filed by the parties. He recom­\nmended denying without prejudice North Carolina’s mo­\ntion to dismiss the Commission’s claims against North\nCarolina on the grounds of sovereign immunity. Prelimi­\nnary Report 4–14. He recommended denying Plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment on Count I, which sought\nenforcement of the Commission’s sanctions resolution. Id.,\nat 14–33. He recommended granting North Carolina’s\ncross-motion to dismiss Count I and other portions of the\nbill of complaint that sought enforcement of the sanctions\nresolution. Id., at 33–34. And he recommended denying\nNorth Carolina’s motion to dismiss the claims in Counts\nII–V. Id., at 34–43. \n   After the Special Master issued his Preliminary Report,\nthe parties engaged in partial discovery and subsequently\nfiled cross-motions for summary judgment. The Special\nMaster’s Second Report recommended denying Plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment on Count II, Second Report\n8–35, and granting North Carolina’s motion for summary\njudgment on Count II, id., at 35–40. Finally, he recom­\nmended denying North Carolina’s motion for summary\njudgment on Plaintiffs’ remaining claims in Counts III–V. Id., at 41–45. Plaintiffs present a total of seven exceptions to the\n\n\nSpecial Master’s two reports. We address them in turn. \n   Their first exception challenges the Special Master’s\nconclusion that the Commission lacked authority to im­\npose monetary sanctions upon North Carolina. The terms\nof the Compact determine that question. \n   Article 4(E) of the Compact sets forth the Commission’s\n“duties and powers.” Among its powers are the authority\n“[t]o revoke the membership of a party [S]tate that will­\nfully creates barriers to the siting of a needed regional\nfacility,” Art. 4(E)(7), 99 Stat. 1875, and the authority “[t]o\nrevoke the membership of a party [S]tate in accordance\nwith Article 7(f),” Art. 4(E)(11), ibid. Conspicuously ab­\nsent from Article 4, however, is any mention of the author­\nity to impose monetary sanctions. Plaintiffs contend that\nauthority may be found elsewhere—in the first paragraph\nof Article 7(F), which provides in relevant part:\n \n      “Any party [S]tate which fails to comply with the\n    provisions of this compact or to fulfill the obligations\n    incurred by becoming a party [S]tate to this compact\n    may be subject to sanctions by the Commission, in­\n    cluding suspension of its rights under this compact\n    and revocation of its status as a party [S]tate.” Id., at\n    1879. The sanctions expressly identified in Article 7(F)—\n“suspension” of rights and “revocation” of party-state\nstatus—flow directly from the Commission’s power in\nArticles 4(E)(7) and (11) to revoke a party State’s member­\nship. That can fairly be understood to include the lesser\npower to suspend a party State’s rights. There is no simi­\nlar grounding in Article 4(E) of authority to impose mone­\ntary sanctions, and the absence is significant. \n   According to Plaintiffs, however, the word “sanctions” in\nArticle 7(F) naturally “includ[es]” monetary sanctions. Since the Compact contains no definition of “sanctions,”\nwe give the word its ordinary meaning. A “sanction” (in\nthe sense the word is used here) is “[t]he detriment loss of\nreward, or other coercive intervention, annexed to a viola­\ntion of a law as a means of enforcing the law.” Webster’s\nNew International Dictionary 2211 (2d ed. 1957) (herein­\nafter Webster’s Second); see Black’s Law Dictionary 1458\n(9th ed. 2009) (“A penalty or coercive measure that results\nfrom failure to comply with a law, rule, or order”). A\nmonetary penalty is assuredly one kind of “sanction.” See\ngenerally Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U. S. 607,\n621 (1992). But there are many others, ranging from the\nwithholding of benefits, or the imposition of a nonmone­\ntary obligation, to capital punishment. The Compact\nsurely does not authorize the Commission to impose all of\nthem. \n   Ultimately, context dictates precisely which “sanctions”\nare authorized under Article 7(F), and nothing in the\nCompact suggests that these include monetary measures. The only two “sanctions” specifically identified as being\nincluded within Article 7(F) are “suspension” of a State’s\nrights under the Compact and “revocation” of its status as\na party State. These are arguably merely examples, and\nmay not exhaust the universe of sanctions the Commission\ncan impose. But they do establish “illustrative applica­\ntion[s] of the general principle,” Federal Land Bank of St.\nPaul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941),\nwhich underlies the kinds of sanctions the Commission\ncan impose. It is significant that both these specifically\nauthorized sanctions are prospective and nonmonetary in\nnature. Moreover, Article 3 of the Compact provides: “The rights\ngranted to the party [S]tates by this compact are addi­\ntional to the rights enjoyed by sovereign states, and noth­\ning in this compact shall be construed to infringe upon,\nlimit, or abridge those rights.” 99 Stat. 1873. Construing\nArticle 7(F) to authorize monetary sanctions would violate\nthis provision, since the primeval sovereign right is im­\nmunity from levies against the government fisc. See, e.g.,\nAlden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 750–751 (1999).\n \n   Finally, a comparison of the Compact’s terms with those\nof “[o]ther interstate compacts, approved by Congress\ncontemporaneously,” Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554,\n565 (1983), confirms that Article 7(F) does not authorize\nmonetary sanctions. At the same time Congress consented\nto this Compact, it consented to three other interstate\ncompacts that expressly authorize their commissions to\nimpose monetary sanctions against the parties to the\ncompacts. See Northeast Interstate Low-Level Radioac­\ntive Waste Management Compact, Art. IV(i)(14), 99 Stat.\n1915 (hereinafter Northeast Compact); Central Midwest\nInterstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art.\nVIII(f), 99 Stat. 1891 (hereinafter Central Midwest Com­\npact); Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste\nCompact, Art. VII(e), 99 Stat. 1870 (hereinafter Central\nCompact). The Compact “clearly lacks the features of\nthese other compacts, and we are not free to rewrite it” to\nempower the Commission to impose monetary sanctions. Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 565.\n \n  Because the Compact does not authorize the Commis­\nsion to impose monetary sanctions, Plaintiffs’ second\nexception—that North Carolina could not avoid monetary\nsanctions by withdrawing from the Compact—is moot. The third exception also pertains to the Commission’s\nsanctions resolution: that North Carolina forfeited its\nright to object to a monetary penalty by failing to partici­\npate at the sanctions hearing. Plaintiffs have failed to\nargue this exception. They have merely noted that North\nCarolina refused to participate at the sanctions hearing,\nand have cited no law in support of the proposition that\nthis was a forfeit. We deem the exception abandoned. It\nwas wisely abandoned, because it is meritless. North\nCarolina opposed the sanctions resolution and denied that\nthe Commission had jurisdiction to impose sanctions\nagainst it. \n  Plaintiffs next take exception to the Special Master’s\nrecommendation that no binding effect or even deference\nbe accorded to the Commission’s conclusion that North\nCarolina violated Article 5(C) of the Compact. We are\nbound by the Commission’s conclusion of breach only if\nthere is “an explicit provision or other clear indicatio[n]” in\nthe Compact making the Commission the “sole arbiter of\ndisputes” regarding a party State’s compliance with the\nCompact. Id., at 569–570. Plaintiffs assert there is such a\nprovision, the second sentence of Article 7(C), which\nstates: “The Commission is the judge of the qualifications\nof the party [S]tates and of its members and of their com­\npliance with the conditions and requirements of this com­\npact and the laws of the party [S]tates relating to the\nenactment of this compact.” 99 Stat. 1879.\n \n  Plaintiffs greatly overread this provision. The limited\nnature of the authority to “judge” that it confers upon the\nCommission is clear from its context. The first sentence of\nArticle 7(C) states that an eligible State “shall be de­\nclared” a party State “upon enactment of this compact into\nlaw by the [S]tate and upon [the] payment of” a $25,000\nfee, as “required by Article 4(H)(1).” Ibid. The second\nsentence makes the Commission the “judge” of four mat­\nters, all of which concern status as a party State or Com\nmission member. First, the Commission is the judge of the\n“qualifications” of a State to become a party State (the\nqualifications set forth in Article 7(A) for the initial party\nStates and in Article 7(B) for States that subsequently\npetition to join). Second, the Commission is the judge of\nthe qualifications of the members of the Commission,\nwhich are specified in Article 4(A). Third, the Commission\nis the judge of a party State’s compliance with the “condi­\ntions” and “requirements” of the Compact. The former\nterm is an obvious reference to Article 7(B): “The Commis­\nsion may establish such conditions as it deems necessary\nand appropriate to be met by a [S]tate wishing . . . to\nbecome a party [S]tate to this [C]ompact.” Id., at 1878. The accompanying term “requirements” also refers to\nArticle 7’s prescriptions for prospective party States, such\nas paying the “fees required” under Article 7(C), id., at\n1879, and obtaining, as Article 7(B) requires, a two-thirds\nvote of the Commission in favor of admission. Finally, the\nCommission is the judge of the “laws of the party [S]tates\nrelating to the enactment of this compact.” Art. 7(C), ibid. Again, that concerns status as a party State, which re­\nquires that the State “enac[t] . . . this compact into law,”\nibid. The Commission is the “judge” of only these specific\nmatters. \n   This is not to say the Commission lacks authority to\ninterpret the Compact or to say whether a party State has\nviolated its terms. That is of course implicit in its power\nto sanction under Article 7(F). But because “the express\nterms of the [Southeast] Compact do not constitute the\nCommission as the sole arbiter” regarding North Caro­\nlina’s compliance with its obligations under the Compact,\nTexas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 569, we are not bound\nto follow the Commission’s findings. \n   Plaintiffs argue that we nonetheless owe deference to\nthe Commission’s conclusion. But unless the text of an\ninterstate compact directs otherwise, we do not review the\nactions of a compact commission “on the deferential model\nof judicial review of administrative action by a federal\nagency.” Id., at 566–567. The terms of this Compact do\nnot establish that “this suit may be maintained only as\none for judicial review of the Commission’s” determination\nof breach. Id., at 567. Accordingly, we do not apply ad­\nministrative-law standards of review, but exercise our\nindependent judgment as to both fact and law in executing\nour role as the “exclusive” arbiter of controversies between\nthe States, §1251(a).\n \n  Plaintiffs’ next two exceptions are to the Special Mas­\nter’s recommendations to deny their motion for summary\njudgment on their breach-of-contract claims, and to grant\nNorth Carolina’s motion for summary judgment on those\nclaims. In resolving motions for summary judgment in\ncases within our original jurisdiction, we are not techni­\ncally bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but\nwe use Rule 56 as a guide. This Court’s Rule 17.2; Ne\nbraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584, 590 (1993). Hence,\nsummary judgment is appropriate where there “is no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact” and the moving\nparty is “entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 56(c); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S.\n317, 322 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S.\n242, 248 (1986).\n \n   Plaintiffs claim North Carolina breached the Compact in\nDecember 1997, when (as it admits) it ceased all efforts\ntoward obtaining a license. At that point, in their view,\nNorth Carolina was no longer “tak[ing] appropriate steps\nto ensure that an application for a license to construct and\noperate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is\nfiled with and issued by the appropriate authority,” Art.\n5(C), 99 Stat. 1877. North Carolina says that once the\nCommission ceased providing financial assistance on\nDecember 1, and once it became clear there was insuffi­\ncient funding to complete the licensing phase, there were\nno more “appropriate” steps to take. The Special Master\nconcluded that the phrase “appropriate steps” in Article\n5(C) was ambiguous, and that the parties’ course of per­\nformance established that North Carolina was not re­\nquired to take steps toward obtaining a license once it was\nmade to bear the remaining financial burden of the licens­\ning phase. Second Report 10–24, 35–36. Plaintiffs take\nexception to that conclusion. \n   Article 5(C) does not require North Carolina to take any\nand all steps to license a regional-disposal facility; only\nthose that are “appropriate.” Plaintiffs contend that this\nrequires North Carolina to take the steps set forth in the\nregulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission govern­\ning the filing and disposition of applications for licenses to\noperate radioactive waste disposal facilities, 10 CFR pt. 61\n(1997). Those regulations set forth some, but certainly not\nall, of the “steps” the State would have to take to obtain a\nlicense. But Article 5(C) does not incorporate the regula­\ntions by reference, much less describe them as the appro\npriate steps. \n   We could accept Plaintiffs’ contention if “appropriate”\nmeant “necessary” (the steps set forth in the regulation\nare assuredly necessary to obtaining a license). But it\ndoes not. Whether a particular step is “appropriate”—\n“[s]pecially suitable; fit; proper,” Webster’s Second 133—\ncould depend upon many factors other than its mere in­\ndispensability to obtaining a license It would not be\nappropriate, for example, to take a step whose cost greatly\nexceeded whatever benefits the license would confer, or if\nit was highly uncertain the license would ever issue. \n   In determining whether, in terminating its efforts to\nobtain a license, North Carolina failed to take what the\nparties considered “appropriate” steps, the parties’ course\nof performance under the Compact is highly significant. See, e.g., New Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S. 767, 830–831\n(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Restatement (Second) of\nContracts §§202(4), 203 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement). That firmly establishes that North Carolina was not ex­\npected to go it alone—to proceed with the very expensive\nlicensing process without any external financial assis­\ntance. The history of the Compact consists entirely of\nshared financial burdens. From the beginning, North\nCarolina made clear that it required financial assistance\nto do the extensive work required for obtaining a license. The Commission promptly declared it was “appropriate\nand necessary” to assist North Carolina with the costs. App. 63. It provided the vast majority of funding for li­\ncensing-related activities—$80 million, compared to North\nCarolina’s $34 million. The Commission repeatedly noted\nthe necessity (and propriety) of providing financial assis­\ntance to North Carolina, and reiterated its dedication to\nsharing the substantial financial burdens of the licensing\nphase. See, e.g., id., at 63, 71, 145. There is nothing to\nsupport the proposition that the other States had an obli­\ngation under the Compact to share the licensing costs\nthrough the Commission; but we doubt that they did so\nout of love for the Tarheel State. They did it, we think,\nbecause that was their understanding of how the Compact\nwas supposed to work. One must take the Commission at\nits word, that it was “appropriate” to share the cost—\nwhich suggests that it would not have been appropriate to\nmake North Carolina proceed on its own. \n   Nor was North Carolina required after December 19,\n1997, to continue to expend its own funds at the same\nlevel it had previously (which Plaintiffs concede had satis­\nfied North Carolina’s obligation to take “appropriate\nsteps”). Once the Commission refused to provide any\nfurther financial assistance, North Carolina would have\nhad to assume an unlimited financial commitment to cover\nall remaining licensing costs. Even if it maintained its\nprior rate of appropriations going forward, it would not\nhave come close to covering the at least $34 million needed\nfor the last steps of the licensing phase. And since the\nincome from the South Carolina facility had been termi­\nnated, there was no apparent prospect of funding for the\nconstruction phase (expected to cost at least $75 million). In connection with its August 1997 refusal to provide\nfurther assistance, the Commission itself had said, “[I]t\nwill be imprudent to continue to deplete Commission\nresources for this purpose if a source of funds is not estab­\nlished soon for the ultimate completion of the project.” Id.,\nat 306, 307; Joint Supp. Fact Brief App. 36, 37. And in\nMarch 1998, the Commission “strongly” reiterated that “it\nwould be imprudent to spend additional funds for licens­\ning activities if funds will not be available to complete the\nproject.” Id., at 59. What was imprudent for the Commis­\nsion would surely have been imprudent (and hence inap­\npropriate) for North Carolina as well. The State would\nhave wasted millions of its taxpayers’ dollars on what\nseemed to be a futile effort. \n   JUSTICE BREYER would uphold Plaintiffs’ challenge on\nthis point. He believes that the Compact obligated North\nCarolina to fund and complete the licensing and construc­\ntion of a nuclear waste facility. Post, at 2, 4–6 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). In fact, how­\never, North Carolina was not even contractually required\nto “secur[e] a license,” post, at 2, but only to take “appro­\npriate steps” to obtain one, Art. 5(C), 99 Stat. 1877. And\nnothing in the terms of the Compact required North Caro­\nlina either to provide “adequate funding” for or to “beg[i]n\nconstruction” on a regional facility, post, at 2. Other con­\ntemporaneously enacted interstate compacts expressly\nprovide that the host State is “responsible for the timely\ndevelopment” of a regional facility, Central Midwest Com­\npact, Art. VI(f), 99 Stat. 1887; Midwest Compact,\nArt. VI(e), id., at 1898, or “shall . . . [c]ause a regional\nfacility to be developed on a timely basis,” Rocky Mountain\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art. III(d)(i), id.,\nat 1903–1904. But the compact here before us has no such\nprovision, and the contrast is telling.1 Texas v. New Mex\nico, 462 U. S., at 565 Moreover, the Commission’s state­\nments described in the preceding paragraph, that it would\nbe imprudent to commit additional resources “ ‘if a source\nof funds is not established soon for the ultimate comple­\ntion of the project,’ ” or “ ‘if funds will not be available to\ncomplete the project,’ ” surely suggest that North Carolina\nis not committed to the funding by contract. \n   JUSTICE BREYER asserts, post, at 4–5, that the rotating­\nhost requirement in the Compact, see Art. 5(A), 99 Stat.\n1873, necessarily implies that North Carolina is solely\nresponsible for the licensing and construction costs of its\nfacility. But all that requirement entails is that a party\nState “shall not be designated” as a host State for a second\ntime before “each [other] party [S]tate” has taken a turn. Ibid. It can perfectly well envision that the States will\ntake turns in bearing the lead responsibility for getting\nthe facility licensed, supervising its construction, and\noperating the facility on its soil. In fact, that is just what\nits text suggests, since it describes the responsibility that\nis to be rotated as the host State’s “obligation . . . to have a\nregional facility operated within its borders.” Ibid. Not to\nconstruct it, or pay for its construction, but to “have [it]\noperated within its borders.” As noted above, other con­\ntemporaneously enacted compacts do spell out the obliga­\ntion of the host State to construct the facility. Still others\nat least provide that the host State will recoup its costs\nthrough disposal fees—which arguably suggests that the\nhost State is to bear the costs. See, e.g., Central Compact,\nArt. III(d),    99    Stat.  1865; Northeast       Compact,\nArt. III(c)(2), id., at 1913. The compact before us here\ndoes not even contain that arguable suggestion. \n   What it comes down to, then, is JUSTICE BREYER’s intui­\ntion that the whole point of the Compact was that each\ndesignated host State would bear the up-front costs of\nlicensing and construction, but would eventually recoup\nthose costs through its regional monopoly on the disposal\nof low-level radioactive waste. Post, at 5–6. He can cite no\nprovision in the Compact which reflects such an under­\nstanding, and the behavior of the parties contradicts it.2 It\nwould, moreover, have been a foolish understanding, since\nthe regional monopoly to recoup construction costs would\nnot be a monopoly if South Carolina withdrew and contin­\nued to operate its facility—which is exactly what hap­\npened in 1995.3 Even leaving aside the principle, dis­\ncussed infra, at 21, that implied obligations are not to be\nread into interstate compacts, JUSTICE BREYER’s intuition\nfails to reflect the reality of what was implied. \n   Plaintiffs take exception to the Special Master’s rejec­\ntion of their alternative argument that North Carolina\nrepudiated the Compact when it announced it would not\ntake further steps toward obtaining a license. They argue\nthat North Carolina’s announcement that it was shutting\ndown the project constituted a refusal to tender any fur­\nther performance under the contract. \n   Plaintiffs’ repudiation theory fails for the same reasons\ntheir breach theory fails. A repudiation occurs when an\nobligor either informs an obligee “that the obligor will\ncommit a breach that would of itself give the obligee a\nclaim for damages for total breach,” Restatement §250(a),\nor performs “a voluntary affirmative act which renders the\nobligor unable or apparently unable to perform without\nsuch a breach,” id., §250(b). Neither event occurred here. North Carolina never informed the Commission (or any\nparty State) that it would not fulfill its Article 5(C) obliga­\ntion to take appropriate steps toward obtaining a license. Rather, it refused to take further steps that were not\nappropriate. Nor did North Carolina take an affirmative\nact that rendered it unable to perform. To the contrary, it\ncontinued to fund the Authority for almost two years; it\nmaintained the records of the Authority; and it preserved\nthe work completed to date while waiting for alternative\nfunding sources that would enable resumption of the\nproject. Plaintiffs further argue that a repudiation was\neffected by North Carolina’s refusal to take further steps\ntoward licensing “except on conditions which go beyond”\nthe terms of the Compact, Restatement §250, Comment b\n(internal quotation marks omitted)—i.e., the provision of\nexternal-financial assistance. But, as we have discussed,\nexternal-financial assistance was contemplated by the\nCompact. \n   Plaintiffs’ final exception is to the Special Master’s\nrecommendation to deny their motion for summary judg­\nment, and to grant North Carolina’s cross-motion for\nsummary judgment, on their claim that North Carolina\nviolated the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing\nwhen it withdrew from the Compact in July 1999. Plain­\ntiffs concede that North Carolina could withdraw from the\nCompact, but contend it could not do so in “bad faith.” And, they assert, its withdrawal after accepting $80 mil­\nlion from the Commission, and with monetary sanctions\npending against it, was the epitome of bad faith. \n   We have never held that an interstate compact approved\nby Congress includes an implied duty of good faith and\nfair dealing. Of course “[e]very contract imposes upon\neach party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its\nperformance and enforcement.” Restatement §205. But\nan interstate compact is not just a contract; it is a federal\nstatute enacted by Congress. If courts were authorized to\nadd a fairness requirement to the implementation of\nfederal statutes, judges would be potent lawmakers in­\ndeed. We do not—we cannot—add provisions to a federal\nstatute. See, e.g., Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503\nU. S. 249, 254 (1992). And in that regard a statute which\nis a valid interstate compact is no different. Texas v. New\nMexico, 462 U. S., at 564, 565. We are especially reluctant\nto read absent terms into an interstate compact given the\nfederalism and separation-of-powers concerns that would\narise were we to rewrite an agreement among sovereign\nStates, to which the political branches consented. As we\nhave said before, we will not “ ‘order relief inconsistent\nwith [the] express terms’ ” of a compact, “no matter what\nthe equities of the circumstances might otherwise invite.” New Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S., at 811 (quoting Texas\nv. New Mexico, supra, at 564).\n \n   The Compact imposes no limitation on North Carolina’s\nexercise of its statutory right to withdraw. Under Article\n7(G), which governed North Carolina’s withdrawal,4 “any\nparty [S]tate may withdraw from the compact by enacting\na law repealing the compact.” 99 Stat. 1879. There is no\nrestriction upon a party State’s enactment of such a law,\nand nothing in the Compact suggests the parties under­\nstood there were “certain purposes for which the expressly\nconferred power . . . could not be employed.” Tymshare,\nInc. v. Covell, 727 F. 2d 1145, 1153 (CADC 1984) (opinion\nfor the court by Scalia, J.). Moreover, Article 3 ensures\nthat no such restrictions may be implied, since it provides\nthat the Compact shall not be “construed to infringe upon,\nlimit or abridge” the sovereign rights of a party State. \n   A comparison of the Compact with other, contemporane­\nously enacted, compacts confirms there is no such limita­\ntion on North Carolina’s right to withdraw. See Texas v.\nNew Mexico, supra, at 565. In contrast to the Compact,\nseveral other compacts concerning the creation of regional\nfacilities for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste\ncontain express good-faith limitations upon a State’s\nexercise of its rights. See, e.g., Central Compact,\nArt. III(f), 99 Stat. 1865; Central Midwest Compact,\nArt. V(a), id., at 1886; Midwest Interstate Low-Level\nRadioactive Waste Management Compact, Art. V(a), id., at\n1897.\n \n  North Carolina submits two exceptions—one to the\nSpecial Master’s Second Report and one to his Preliminary\nReport. North Carolina takes exception to the recommendation\nof the Second Report to deny without prejudice its motion\nfor summary judgment on the merits of Plaintiffs’ equita­\nble claims in Counts III–V. North Carolina’s motion was\nbased on the ground that, as a matter of law, its obliga­\ntions are governed entirely by the Compact. The Special\nMaster recommended denying the motion without preju­\ndice, because the claims in Counts III–V “requir[e] further\nbriefing and argument, and possibly further discovery.” Second Report 41. A threshold question for all claims in\nthose Counts, for example, is whether they “belong to the\nCommission, the Plaintiff States, or both.” Ibid. Perhaps\nthe States can bring them in their capacity as parens\npatriae, but as the Special Master noted “the parties have\nnot adequately briefed this issue, and its resolution in this\ncase is unclear.” Id., at 42–43.\n \n  We think it was reasonable for the Special Master to\ndefer ruling. We granted the Special Master discretion to\n“direct subsequent proceedings” and “to submit such re­\nports as he may deem appropriate.” 540 U. S., at 1014. He could have deferred filing any report until full factual\ndiscovery had been completed and all of the legal issues,\nmany of which are novel and challenging, had been fully\nbriefed, considered, and decided. Instead, he concluded\nthat our immediate resolution of Counts I and II would\nfacilitate the efficient disposition of the case; and in agree­\ning to hear exceptions to his Preliminary Report and\nSecond Report we implicitly agreed. His deferral of ruling\non the merits of Counts III–V is part and parcel of the\nsame case management, and we find no reason to upset it. \n   North Carolina takes exception to the Special Master’s\nrecommendation in his Preliminary Report to deny with­\nout prejudice its motion to dismiss the Commission’s\nclaims on the ground that they are barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment to the Constitution and by structural princi­\nples of state sovereign immunity. The Special Master\nassumed for the sake of argument that a State possesses\nsovereign immunity against a claim brought by an entity,\nlike the Commission, created by an interstate compact,5\nPreliminary Report 5. But he recommended denying\nNorth Carolina’s motion to dismiss “at this point in the\nproceedings.” Ibid. \n  The Special Master relied upon our decision in Arizona\nv. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983), which held that the\nEleventh Amendment did not bar the participation of\nseveral Indian Tribes in an original action concerning the\nallocation of rights to the waters of the Colorado River. The United States had already intervened, in its capacity\nas trustee for several Indian Tribes; but the Tribes moved\nto intervene as well, and the States opposed. We granted\nthe Tribes’ motion, stating that the States do not enjoy\nsovereign immunity against the United States, and “[t]he\nTribes do not seek to bring new claims or issues against\nthe States, but only ask leave to participate in an adjudi­\ncation of their vital water rights that was commenced by\nthe United States.” Id., at 614. Thus, “our judicial power\nover the controversy is not enlarged by granting leave to\nintervene, and the States’ sovereign immunity protected\nby the Eleventh Amendment is not compromised.” Ibid. Relying on this holding, the Special Master held that\nsovereign immunity does not bar the Commission’s suit, so\nlong as the Commission asserts the same claims and seeks\nthe same relief as the other plaintiffs. Whether that is so,\nhe said, “cannot be resolved without further factual and\nlegal development[s],” Preliminary Report 6, and so North\nCarolina is free to renew its motion at a later point, id., at\n13–14. See Second Report 45–48.\n \n Assuming (as the Special Master did) that the Commis­\nsion’s claims against North Carolina implicate sovereign\nimmunity, we agree with his disposition. North Carolina\ncontends that making application of the Constitution’s\nwaiver of sovereign immunity turn upon whether a\nnonsovereign party seeks to expand the relief sought is\n—————— \n \ninconsistent with our decisions construing state sovereign\nimmunity as a “personal privilege.” College Savings Bank\nv. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527\nU. S. 666, 675 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Alden, 527 U. S., at 758. But nothing in those\ncases suggests that Arizona v. California has been implic­\nitly overruled.6 See Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long\nTerm Care, Inc., 529 U. S. 1, 18 (2000). Neither of them\narose under our original jurisdiction, and neither cited\nArizona v. California or discussed—at all—the sovereign\nimmunity issue that case addressed. That sovereign\nimmunity is a personal privilege of the States says noth­\ning about whether that privilege “is not compromised,”\nArizona v. California, supra, at 614, by an additional,\nnonsovereign plaintiff’s bringing an entirely overlapping\nclaim for relief that burdens the State with no additional\ndefense or liability.7\n \n   North Carolina contends that Arizona v. California\ncannot apply to the Commission’s claims, because the\nCommission does not—indeed, cannot—assert the same\nclaims or seek the same relief as the plaintiff States. We\ndisagree. In the bill of complaint, the States and the\nCommission assert the same claims and request the same\nrelief. Bill of Complaint ¶¶62–86 and Prayer for Relief. Their claim for restitution of $80 million cannot, given the\nother allegations of the complaint, be thought to be $80\nmillion payable to each of the four plaintiff States and the\nCommission. \n   North Carolina argues, however, that summary judg­\nment in its favor is appropriate because it is clear that the\nCommission, and not the plaintiff States, provided $80\nmillion to North Carolina—wherefore, as a matter of law,\nonly the Commission can claim entitlement to $80 million,\neither as a measure of damages for breach of the Compact\nunder Counts I and II of the bill of complaint, see Re­\nstatement §370, Comment a, and §373, or under the un­\njust enrichment, promissory estoppel, and money-had-and­\nreceived theories of recovery in Counts III, IV, and V, see,\ne.g., Restatement of Restitution §1, Comment a (1936). And, it contends, a stand-alone suit by the Commission is\nbarred by sovereign immunity. \n   With regard to Counts I and II, at least, we disagree. The Commission’s claims under those Compact-related\nCounts are wholly derivative of the States’ claims. See\nArizona v. California, supra, at 614. The Commission is\n“a legal entity separate and distinct from” the States that\nare parties to the Compact. Art. 4(M)(1), 99 Stat. 1877. Since it is not a party it has neither a contractual right to\nperformance by the party States nor enforceable statutory\nrights under Article 5 of the Compact, see Bennett v.\nSpear, 520 U. S. 154, 162–163 (1997). The Compact does,\nhowever, authorize the Commission to “act or appear on\nbehalf of any party [S]tate or [S]tates . . . as an intervenor\nor party in interest before . . . any court of law,” Art.\n4(E)(10), 99 Stat. 1875, and it is obviously in this capacity\nthat the Commission seeks to vindicate the plaintiff\nStates’ statutory and contractual rights in Counts I and II. Its Count I and Count II claims therefore rise or fall with\nthe claims of the States. While the Commission may not\nbring them in a stand-alone action under this Court’s\noriginal jurisdiction, see §1251(a), it may assert them in\nthis Court alongside the plaintiff States, see Arizona v.\nCalifornia, 460 U. S., at 614. The summary judgment\ndisallowing the underlying claims on their merits renders\nthe sovereign immunity question with regard to any relief\nthe Commission alone might have on those claims moot. \n  Counts III–V, which do not rely upon the Compact,\nstand on a different footing. As to them, while the Com­\nmission again seemingly makes the same claims and seeks\nthe same relief as the States, it is conceivable that as a\nmatter of law the Commission’s claims are not identical. The Commission can claim restitution as the party that\npaid the money to North Carolina; the other plaintiffs\ncannot claim it on that basis. Whether this means that\nthe claims are not identical for Arizona v. California pur­\nposes, and that the Commission’s Counts III–V claims\nmust be dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, is a\nquestion that the Special Master declined to resolve until\nthe merits issues were further clarified. We have ap­\nproved his deferral of those issues, and we likewise ap­\nprove his deferral of the related sovereign immunity issue. \n  We overrule the exceptions of Plaintiffs and North\nCarolina to the Special Master’s Reports, and we adopt the\nrecommendations of the Special Master. We grant North\nCarolina’s motion to dismiss Count I. We grant North\nCarolina’s motion for summary judgment on Count II. We\ndeny Plaintiffs’ motions for judgment on Counts I and II. And we deny without prejudice North Carolina’s motion to\ndismiss the Commission’s claims on the grounds of sover­\neign immunity and its motion for summary judgment on\nCounts III–V.\n It is so ordered.",

    "data": "MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court. The petitioner was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment for criminal contempt stemming from his refusal to testify before a federal grand jury. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 247 F. 2d 332. The case was brought here primarily to review the validity of the procedure which resulted in the contempt adjudication. 356 U. S. 926. Other issues relate to the nature and extent of immunity from prosecution conferred by § 205 (e) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended,    and the severity of the punishment imposed by the District Court. A grand jury in the Southern District of New York investigating possible violations of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act    issued a subpoena directing the petitioner to appear and testify as to \"all and everything which you may know in regard to an alleged violation of Sections 309, 322, Title 49, United States Code.\" In response to this subpoena the petitioner appeared and, after being sworn, answered a few preliminary questions. He was then asked six further questions concededly relevant to the grand jury's inquiry. These he refused to answer upon the ground of possible self-incrimination. After consulting with his lawyer, who was continuously present in an adjoining anteroom, the petitioner persisted in his refusal to answer, although advised at length by the Assistant United States Attorney that the applicable     statute conferred complete immunity from prosecution as to any matter concerning which the petitioner might testify, and that, therefore, \"you do not have any privilege to plead the Fifth Amendment.\" Thereupon the scene of the proceedings shifted to the courtroom, where the grand jury sought the aid of the district judge. After being apprised of what had transpired in the grand jury room, the district judge heard extensive argument by counsel as to the scope of immunity afforded a grand jury witness under the applicable statute. Following a weekend recess the district judge ruled that under the statute the petitioner would be accorded immunity as extensive as the privilege he had asserted, and directed that the petitioner therefore return to the grand jury room and answer the questions. Later the same day the grand jury again returned to the courtroom \"to request the aid and assistance of the Court.\" The district judge was advised through the official reporter that the petitioner had refused to obey the court's order to answer the questions. The judge then addressed the same questions to the petitioner in the grand jury's presence. Each question was met with a refusal to answer upon the ground of possible self-incrimination. The petitioner was thereupon explicitly directed by the judge to answer each question, and he just as explicitly refused. The judge inquired whether the petitioner would persist in his refusal if he returned to the grand jury room and were again asked the questions there. The petitioner replied that he would. After further argument by counsel, the district judge held the petitioner in contempt and imposed sentence. Throughout the proceedings in the courtroom the petitioner was represented by counsel, who unsuccessfully advanced three basic contentions: (1) A witness who testifies before a grand jury investigating offenses under the Motor Carrier Act is accorded no statutory immunity     from subsequent prosecution based upon his testimony. (2) Even if some immunity is conferred, it is not coextensive with the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. (3) In any event, the District Court, by adjudging the petitioner in criminal contempt without following the procedural requirements of Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, deprived the petitioner of due process of law. The same contentions are advanced here. In addition, we are asked to hold that the sentence of 15 months' imprisonment was an abuse of the District Court's discretion. In determining that § 205 (e) of the Motor Carrier Act clothed the petitioner with statutory immunity coextensive with his constitutional privilege not to incriminate himself, the District Court and the Court of Appeals were plainly correct. The relevant statutory language is unambiguous: \". . . and any person subpenaed or testifying in connection with any matter under investigation under this chapter shall have the same rights, privileges, and immunities and be subject to the same duties, liabilities, and penalties as though such matter arose under chapter 1 of this title [Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act] . . . .\"    The obvious purpose and effect of this     language is to confer the same immunity upon a witness testifying in an investigation under Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act as is conferred upon one testifying in an investigation under Part I. Both Part I and Part II contain criminal sanctions, and the power of a grand jury to investigate violations of either Part is unquestioned. The statute which confers immunity upon a witness testifying in a grand jury investigation under Part I was enacted in 1893. For more than half a century it has     been settled that this statute confers immunity from prosecution coextensive with the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, and that the witness may not therefore lawfully refuse to testify. Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591 (1896). The context in which the doctrine originated and the history of its reaffirmance through the years have been so recently re-examined by this Court in Ullman v. United States, 350 U. S. 422, as to make it a needless exercise to retrace that ground here. Suffice it to repeat that Brown v. Walker has become \"part of our constitutional fabric.\" 350 U. S., at 438. It is thus clearly too late in the day to question the constitutional sufficiency of the immunity provided under Part I of the Act. In contending that this immunity is not fully imported into Part II the petitioner grasps at straws. He points out that the above-quoted language of 49 U. S. C. § 305 (d) which incorporates into Part II the immunity provisions of Part I is separated by only a semicolon from a provision which gives the Commission investigative powers under Part II. See footnote 3. He would therefore have us rewrite the section so as to make the immunity provision applicable only to witnesses appearing before the Commission, not to those appearing before a grand jury or in a court. Such a construction would not only do violence to plain language, but also, as the Court of Appeals observed, to the whole structure of the Interstate Commerce Act. See 247 F. 2d, at 336-337. The petitioner argues alternatively that even if some immunity is granted by Part II to a grand jury witness, the immunity is not commensurate with that of Part I, and that its scope is therefore constitutionally insufficient. The contention is that § 305 (d) provides immunity from     prosecution only for offenses related to violations of the Motor Carrier Act itself because of the clause appearing at the beginning of the section\"So far as may be necessary for the purposes of this chapter.\" See footnote 3. Assuming that this clause limits the immunity provision of the section at all, it clearly limits only the class of witnesses to whom the immunity will attach, not the scope of the immunity conferred. The petitioner \"subpoenaed. . . in connection with [a] matter under investigation under this chapter . . . necessary for the purposes of this chapter\" was clearly within that class. Congress thus provided that the petitioner could not and would not incriminate himself by answering the questions put to him. He could not \"be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing, concerning which he [might] testify. . . .\" 49 U. S. C. § 46. He therefore had an unqualified duty to answer the questions as he was directed to do. We turn then to the petitioner's attack upon the validity of the procedure which the District Court followed in adjudicating him in contempt. This procedure, it is contended, robbed the petitioner not only of the safeguards     of notice, opportunity to prepare a defense, and a hearing, but also of the presumption of innocence and other rights basic to a fair criminal trial. In view of the apparent breadth of the petitioner's argument, it may promote analysis of this aspect of the case to emphasize at the outset what it does not involve. This is not a situation where the contempt was in any sense personal to the judge, raising issues of possible unfairness resulting from the operation of human emotions. Cf. Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517, 539; Sacher v. United States, 343 U. S. 1; Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11. This is not a case of \"misbehavior\" involving factual issues as to the nature of the petitioner's conduct and whether it occurred in the \"presence\" of the court or \"so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice.\" Cf. Ex parte Savin, 131 U. S. 267; Ex parte Cuddy, 131 U. S. 280; Nye v. United States, 313 U. S. 33, 44-53. Moreover, the petitioner does not question the power of the court to punish disobedience of its lawful order as a criminal contempt,    and to do so summarily, if the disobedience occurs in the presence of the court and in the sight or hearing of the judge. The issue presented is thus considerably narrower than the broad strokes of the petitioner's argument would at     first suggest. Indeed, the argument boils down to the contention that when the petitioner first disobeyed the court's order in the grand jury room the court had no choice but to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against him at once, under the provisions of Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,    and that it therefore violated his rights by calling him before it and giving him another opportunity to answer the questions before adjudicating him in contempt. This argument disregards the historic relationship between court and grand jury. It finds support in neither precedent nor reason. A grand jury is clothed with great independence in many areas, but it remains an appendage of the court, powerless to perform its investigative function without the court's aid, because powerless itself to compel the testimony of witnesses. It is the court's process which summons the witness to attend and give testimony, and it is the court which must compel a witness to testify if, after appearing, he refuses to do so. When the petitioner first refused to answer the grand jury's questions, he was guilty of no contempt. He was     entitled to persist in his refusal until the court ordered him to answer. Unless, therefore, it was to be frustrated in its investigative purpose, the grand jury had to do exactly what it didturn to the court for help. If the court had ruled that the privilege against self-incrimination had been properly invoked, that would have been the end of the matter. Even after an adverse ruling upon his claim of privilege, the petitioner was still guilty of no contempt. It was incumbent upon the court unequivocally to order the petitioner to answer. Cf. Wong Gim Ying v. United States, 98 U. S. App. D. C. 23, 231 F. 2d 776. The court did so. When upon his return to the grand jury room the petitioner again refused to answer the grand jury's questions, now in direct disobedience of the court's order, he was for the first time guilty of contempt. At that point a contempt proceeding could unquestionably and quite properly have been initiated. Since this disobedience of the order did not take place in the actual presence of the court, and thus could be made known to the court only by the taking of evidence, the proceeding would have been conducted upon notice and hearing in conformity with Rule 42 (b). See Carlson v. United States, 209 F. 2d 209, 216 (C. A. 1st Cir.). A judge more intent upon punishing the witness than aiding the grand jury in its investigation might well have taken just such a course. Instead, the court made another effort to induce the petitioner to testify. Again unequivocally advising the petitioner that the statute afforded him complete immunity, the court directed him to answer the questions. Had the petitioner done so, he would have purged himself of contempt, and the grand jury's investigation could have proceeded. His deliberate refusal,     continuing his contempt, cf. Yates v. United States, 355 U. S. 66, 75, left the court no choice. Since the disobedience occurred in the court's presence, it was clearly proper to proceed under Rule 42 (a). Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is no innovation. It simply makes \"more explicit\" the long-settled usages of law governing the procedure to be followed in contempt proceedings. No decision of this Court has ever questioned the propriety of summary contempt proceedings in aid of a grand jury investigation. Repeated decisions of this Court and the Courts of Appeals have, at least sub silentio, approved such a procedure, stemming as it does from the usages of the common law. Indeed less than a decade ago this Court did not consider the question sufficiently doubtful to merit discussion. In the light, therefore, of both reason and     authority, we hold that the court's action in affording the petitioner a locus penitentiae before finally adjudicating him in contempt was entirely proper. We hold, finally, that the sentence of 15 months' imprisonment was not an abuse of the District Court's discretion. Because there is no statutory limit upon a District Court's sentencing power in cases of criminal contempt, Green v. United States, 356 U. S. 165, this Court is not without power to review its exercise. Cf. Yates v. United States, 356 U. S. 363; Nilva v. United States, 352 U. S. 385, 396. But the decision is one primarily for the District Court, to be made \"with the utmost sense of responsibility and circumspection.\" Green v. United States, supra, at 188. The record does not indicate that the district judge's decision was otherwise reached. Before sentence was imposed, the petitioner's counsel was fully, repeatedly and patiently heard. Affirmed.",

Deboris Calcano-Martinez, Sergio Madrid, and Fazila Khan are all lawful permanent residents of the United States subject to administratively final orders of removal. They conceded that they are deportable based upon their past criminal convictions, but each filed both a petition for review in the Second Circuit pursuant to 8 U.S.  . § 1252(a)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. V) and a habeas corpus petition in the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.  . § 2241 in order to challenge the Board of Immigration Appeals' determination that, as a matter of law, petitioners were ineligible to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation under former § 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 182, 8 U.S.  . § 1182(c) (1994 ed.). Their petitions for review were consolidated in the Court of Appeals, which subsequently dismissed the petitions for lack of jurisdiction, holding that petitioners could nevertheless pursue their constitutional and statutory claims in a district court habeas action brought pursuant to 28 U.S.  . § 2241. 232 F.3d     (CA2 2000). We granted certiorari in this case, 531 U.S.      (2001), and in INS  v.

St. Cyr, ante, p. 289, we agree with the Court of Appeals that it lacks jurisdiction to hear      the petitions for direct review at issue in this case and that petitioners must, therefore, proceed with their petitions for habeas corpus if they wish to obtain relief. As part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009-546, Congress adopted new provisions governing the judicial review of immigration orders. See 8 U.S.  . § 1252 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (codifying these procedures). Like the prior statute, the new provision vests the courts of appeals with the authority to consider petitions challenging \"final orders\" commanding the \"removal\" of aliens from the United States. § 1252(a)(1). However, unlike the previous provisions, the new statute expressly precludes the courts of appeals from exercising \"jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against any alien who is removable by reason of\" a conviction for certain criminal offenses, including any aggravated felony. § 1252(a)(2)(C).         As petitioners in this case were convicted of \"aggravated felonies\" within the meaning of the relevant statutes,    the plain language of § 1252(a)(2)(C) fairly explicitly strips the courts of appeals of jurisdiction to hear their claims on petitions for direct review. Without much discussion, the Court of Appeals so held. 232 F.3d, at        . Before this Court, petitioners primarily argue that constitutional considerations and background principles of statutory interpretation require that they be afforded some forum for the adjudication of the merits of their claims. They devote the bulk of their briefs to arguing that the Court of Appealsmotivated by these concernsproperly interpreted IIRIRA's jurisdiction-stripping provision not to preclude aliens such as petitioners from pursuing habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.  . § 2241. Brief for Petitioners 12-42, 44-49. In the alternative, they argue that we might construe the same provisions as stripping jurisdiction from the courts of appeals over only some matters, leaving in place their jurisdiction to directly review petitions raising claims previously cognizable under § 2241. Id., at 42-44. We agree with petitioners that leaving aliens without a forum for adjudicating claims such as those raised in this case would raise serious constitutional questions. We also agree with petitionersand the Court of Appealsthat these concerns can best be alleviated by construing the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of that statute not to preclude aliens such as petitioners from pursuing habeas relief pursuant to § 2241. See St. Cyr, ante, at 314. Finding no support in the text or history of § 1252 for concluding that the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to hear petitions such as those brought in this case, but concluding      that Congress has not spoken with sufficient clarity to strip the district courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions raising identical claims, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in all particulars. It is so ordered.",

    "data": "MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court. The Federal Safety Appliance Acts require railroad cars used in interstate commerce to be equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact. This case brings before us for review another action for damages by a railroad employee under the Safety Appliance Acts and the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The trial court instructed the jury that there could be no liability based on any \"defect\" in the \"automatic coupling system,\" but submitted the case on issues of negligence. There was a verdict against the plaintiff upon which judgment for the railroad was entered. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 170 F.2d    . We granted certiorari because of the confusion which has developed in the application of the two statutes. 336 U.S.    . Our duty to review certain cases of this nature is settled. Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336 U.S.    (1949); Keeton v. Thompson, 326 U.S.     (1945); Ellis v. Union Pacific R. Co., 329 U.S.     (1947). On February 2, 1946, the petitioner was injured while acting as \"swing man\" of a switching crew on the respondent railroad. The crew of five men were engaged at night in switching operations at and near the International Paper Company plant in Panama City, Florida. The conductor of the crew had laid out a plan for coupling together a number of cars, some of which were on storage tracks and one on the main line. The ultimate objective was to switch some wood rack cars loaded with pulpwood into the wood yard of the paper concern. In the conductor's absence petitioner was in charge of the switching operations and attempted to carry out the instructions given him. The engine, after coupling in front of it a box car followed by eight flat cars, was engaged in backing the train of cars onto the main line, in order to couple, at the end of the train, a Louisville & Nashville Railroad wood rack car loaded with pulpwood. The petitioner had previously set the brake and had opened both lips of the coupler on the L. & N. car preparatory to attaching the car to the train. He had given the footboard man the slow signal ahead for coupling, which had been passed on to the engineer. The engineer brought the train forward and hit the L. & N. car in the usual manner necessary for coupling, but instead of coupling to the train the L. & N. car started rolling down the tracks, which were, at this point, on a downgrade. Petitioner saw that the L. & N. car had not coupled and ran after it for some fifty or sixty feet, climbed to the bulkhead where the brake wheel was located, and applied the hand brake to stop the car. He was able to bring the car to a stop only after it had left the main line and traveled around a curve for some six car lengths. Looking up, he saw the train moving toward him about twenty feet away at a speed which conflicting testimony places at a maximum of fifteen miles per hour to a minimum of two miles per hour. Petitioner grabbed the brake wheel to brace himself, but the train hit the L. & N. car so violently that it threw the petitioner about six feet down into its hold. This time the coupling was successful, and as the L. & N. car jerked from the impact some      of the pulpwood loaded in the car was pitched forward on the petitioner, causing the alleged injuries. The engineer testified that he did not know whether the L. & N. car had safely coupled at the first impact. He contended that after this impact, he received the come-ahead signal from the petitioner, whereupon he moved the train forward at about six miles per hour. The testimony was in sharp conflict with reference to this signal, as well as to other details of the incident. Defendant moved for a directed verdict as to the failure to couple on the ground that while the coupler failed to couple on the initial impact, \"it worked previously and worked subsequently, and the proof shows no defect in it; and under the finding in Western & Atlantic Railroad Company vs. Gentile, 198 S.E.    , that this rule of law is laid down . . . that the failure of couplers to couple automatically by impact is not per se a violation of this Act . . . .\" The District Court granted the motion, instructing the jury \"that there is no evidence in this case . . . from which you could properly find there was defect in this . . . automatic coupling system on that car.\" The Court of Appeals affirmed on another theory: that the failure to couple on the first impact \"was the remote, not the proximate, cause of plaintiff's injuries.\" The trial court did submit the cause on the more general negligence allegations, and on these a verdict was returned for the respondent. But petitioner objects to those portions of the trial court's charge covering contributory negligence. The Court of Appeals admitted that standing alone, the charge \"might possibly have been prejudicial,\" but stated that here it was \"inconsequential.\" In these conclusions the court below was in error. First. Since 1893 the Congress has made it unlawful for a railroad company such as respondent to use any car on its line \"not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact.\" This Court has repeatedly attempted      to make clear that this is an absolute duty unrelated to negligence, and that the absence of a \"defect\" cannot aid the railroad if the coupler was properly set    and failed to couple on the occasion in question. See O'Donnell v. Elgin, Joliet & Eastern R. Co., 338 U.S.    , 390 (1949), and cases cited. The fact that the coupler functioned properly on other occasions is immaterial. But respondent contends that when the L. & N. car came to rest after the failure of the coupler \"its capacity for doing harm was spent.\" The second movement, it argues, in which the coupling worked perfectly, started a new chain of events resulting in Carter's injury. We cannot agree that the various events were so divisible. This was a two-pronged complaint, alleging the right to recover under the Safety Appliance Act and the Federal Employers' Liability Act. In this situation the test of causal relation stated in the Employers' Liability Act is applicable, the violation of the Appliance Act supplying the wrongful act necessary to ground liability under the F. E. L. A. See Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 291 U.S.    , 216 (1934); O'Donnell v. Elgin, Joliet & Eastern R. Co., supra; Coray v. Southern Pacific Co., 335 U.S.     (1949). Sometimes that violation is described as \"negligence per se,\" H. R. Rep. No. 1386, 60th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6; San Antonio & A. P. R. Co. v. Wagner, 241 U.S.    , 484 (1916); but we have made clear in the O'Donnell case that that term is a confusing label for what is simply a violation of an absolute duty. Once the violation is established, only causal relation is in issue. And Congress has directed liability if the      injury resulted \"in whole or in part\" from defendant's negligence or its violation of the Safety Appliance Act. We made clear in Coray v. Southern Pacific Co., supra, 335 U. S. at 523, that if the jury determines that the defendant's breach is \"a contributory proximate cause\" of injury, it may find for the plaintiff. See also Union Pacific R. Co. v. Hadley, 246 U.S.    , 333 (1918); Spokane & I. E. R. Co. v. Campbell, 241 U.S.    , 510 (1916). Certainly there was evidence upon which a jury could find a causal relation between the failure to couple, the action of petitioner in running and stopping the rolling car, the engineer's justified assumption that the car had coupled when in fact it had failed to do so, and the continued movement of the train into the standing car, thus causing injury. See Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Layton, 243 U.S.     (1917); Erie R. Co. v. Caldwell, 264 F.     (1920). It was error to take this phase of the case from the jury. Second. In ruling on petitioner's general negligence allegations the trial court fell into errors in its charge on contributory negligence    which occur so frequently that we will discuss them briefly. The charge is replete with phrases such as, \"if you should find his [the petitioner's] own negligence was the proximate cause of whatever injury followed,\" the verdict must be for the respondent. With proper explanations, the court could have advised the jury that if petitioner's own negligence was the sole proximate cause of his injury, the verdict must be for respondent; but here the court again and again used such      phrases as \"if you should find his injury was directly or proximately caused by his own negligence,\" verdict must be for the railroad; and if you find \"that his own negligence in no manner contributed to his injury\"; \"if you find . . . he was not negligent in any manner,\" the verdict must be for the plaintiff. We are unable to say such error was inconsequential. It violates the direct command of the Act of Congress. The \"fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee . . . .\" 35 Stat. 66, 45 U.S.  . § 53.    The negligence of the petitioner and that of the railroad should have been submitted to the      jury, and in the light of this comparison a verdict reached that would do justice to all concerned. See Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 318 U.S.   , 65 (1943). The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. Reversed.",

    "data": "Justice Blackmun, delivered the opinion of the Court. We are confronted in this case with an issue concerning § 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.  . § 506(d). May      a debtor \"strip down\" a creditor's lien on real property to the value of the collateral, as judicially determined, when that value is less than the amount of the claim secured by the lien? On June 1, 1978, respondents loaned $119,000 to petitioner Aletha Dewsnup and her husband, T. LaMar Dewsnup, since deceased. The loan was accompanied by a Deed of Trust granting a lien on two parcels of Utah farmland owned by the Dewsnups. Petitioner defaulted the following year. Under the terms of the Deed of Trust, respondents at that point could have proceeded against the real property collateral by accelerating the maturity of the loan, issuing a notice of default, and selling the land at a public foreclosure sale to satisfy the debt. See also Utah Code Ann. §§ 57-120 to 57-137 (1990 and Supp. 1991).      Respondents did issue a notice of default in 1981. Before the foreclosure sale took place, however, petitioner sought reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.  . § 1101 et seq. That bankruptcy petition was dismissed, as was a subsequent Chapter 11 petition. In June 1984, petitioner filed a petition seeking liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Code, 11 U.S.  . § 701 et seq. Because of the pendency of these bankruptcy proceedings, respondents were not able to proceed to the foreclosure sale. See 11 U.S.  . § 362 (1988 ed. and Supp. II). In 1987, petitioner filed the present adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Utah seeking, pursuant to § 506, to \"avoid\" a portion of respondents' lien. App. 3. Petitioner represented that the debt of approximately $120,000 then owed to respondents exceeded the fair market value of the land and that, therefore, the Bankruptcy Court should reduce the lien to that value. According to petitioner, this was compelled by the interrelationship of the security-reducing provision of § 506(a) and the lien-voiding provision of § 506(d). Under § 506(a) (\"An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest . . . is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property\"), respondents would have an \"allowed secured claim\" only to the extent of the judicially determined value of their collateral. And under § 506(d) (\"To the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void\"), the court would be required to void the lien as to the remaining portion of respondents' claim, because the remaining portion was not an \"allowed secured claim\" within the meaning of § 506(a). The Bankruptcy Court refused to grant this relief. In re Dewsnup, 87 B.R.     (1988). After a trial, it determined that the then value of the land subject to the Deed of Trust was $39,000. It indulged in the assumption that the property had been abandoned by the trustee pursuant to § 554,      and reasoned that once property was abandoned it no longer fell within the reach of § 506(a), which applies only to \"property in which the estate has an interest,\" and therefore was not covered by § 506(d). The United States District Court, without a supporting opinion, summarily affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's judgment of dismissal with prejudice. App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in its turn, also affirmed. In re Dewsnup, 908 F.2d     (1990). Starting from the \"fundamental premise\" of § 506(a) that a claim is subject to reduction in security only when the estate has an interest in the property, the court reasoned that because the estate had no interest in abandoned property, § 506(a) did not apply (nor, by implication, did § 506(d)). Id., at 590-591. The court then noted that a contrary result would be inconsistent with § 722 under which a debtor has a limited right to redeem certain personal property. Id., at 592. Because the result reached by the Court of Appeals was at odds with that reached by the Third Circuit in Gaglia v. First Federal Savings & Loan Assn., 889 F.2d     , 1306 1311 (1989), and was expressly recognized by the Tenth Circuit as being in conflict, see 908 F.2d, at    , we granted certiorari. 498 U.S.      (1991). As we read their several submissions, the parties and their amici are not in agreement in their respective approaches to the problem of statutory interpretation that confronts us. Petitioner-debtor takes the position that §§ 506(a) and 506(d) are complementary and to be read together. Because, under § 506(a), a claim is secured only to the extent of the judicially determined value of the real property on which the lien is fixed, a debtor can void a lien on the property pursuant to § 506(d) to the extent the claim is no longer secured and thus is not \"an allowed secured claim.\" In other words, § 506(a) bifurcates classes of claims allowed under § 502 into secured      claims and unsecured claims; any portion of an allowed claim deemed to be unsecured under § 506(a) is not an \"allowed secured claim\" within the lien-voiding scope of § 506(d). Petitioner argues that there is no exception for unsecured property abandoned by the trustee. Petitioner's amicus argues that the plain language of § 506(d) dictates that the proper portion of an under secured lien on property in a Chapter 7 case is void whether or not the property is abandoned by the trustee. It further argues that the rationale of the Court of Appeals would lead to evisceration of the debtor's right of redemption and the elimination of an undersecured creditor's ability to participate in the distribution of the estate's assets. Respondents primarily assert that § 506(d) is not, as petitioner would have it, \"rigidly tied\" to § 506(a), Brief for Respondents 7. They argue that § 506(a) performs the function of classifying claims by true secured status at the time of distribution of the estate to ensure fairness to unsecured claimants. In contrast, the lien-voiding § 506(d) is directed to the time at which foreclosure is to take place, and, where the trustee has abandoned the property, no bankruptcy distributional purpose is served by voiding the lien. In the alternative, respondents, joined by the United States as amicus curiae, argue more broadly that the words \"allowed secured claim\" in § 506(d) need not be read as an indivisible term of art defined by reference to § 506(a), which by its terms is not a definitional provision. Rather, the words should be read term-by-term to refer to any claim that is, first, allowed, and, second, secured. Because there is no question that the claim at issue here has been \"allowed\" pursuant to § 502 of the Code and is secured by a lien with recourse to the underlying collateral, it does not come within the scope of § 506(d), which voids only liens corresponding to claims that have not been allowed and secured. This reading of § 506(d), according to respondents and the United States, gives the provision the simple and sensible function      of voiding a lien whenever a claim secured by the lien itself has not been allowed. It ensures that the Code's determination not to allow the underlying claim against the debtor personally is given full effect by preventing its assertion against the debtor's property. Respondents point out that pre-Code bankruptcy law preserved liens like respondents' and that there is nothing in the Code's legislative history that reflects any intent to alter that law. Moreover, according to respondents, the \"fresh start\" policy cannot justify an impairment of respondents' property rights, for the fresh start does not extend to an in rem claim against property but is limited to a discharge of personal liability. The foregoing recital of the contrasting positions of the respective parties and their amici demonstrates that § 506 of the Bankruptcy Code and its relationship to other provisions of that Code do embrace some ambiguities. See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, ch. 506 and, in particular, ¶ 506.07 (15th ed. 1991). Hypothetical applications that come to mind and those advanced at oral argument illustrate the difficulty of interpreting the statute in a single opinion that would apply to all possible fact situations. We therefore focus upon the      case before us and allow other facts to await their legal resolution on another day. We conclude that respondents' alternative position, espoused also by the United States, although not without its difficulty, generally is the better of the several approaches. Therefore, we hold that § 506(d) does not allow petitioner to \"strip down\" respondents' lien, because respondents' claim is secured by a lien and has been fully allowed pursuant to § 502. Were we writing on a clean slate, we might be inclined to agree with petitioner that the words \"allowed secured claim\" must take the same meaning in § 506(d) as in § 506(a). But, given the ambiguity in the text, we are not convinced that Congress intended to depart from the preCode rule that liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected. 1. The practical effect of petitioner's argument is to freeze the creditor's secured interest at the judicially determined valuation. By this approach, the creditor would lose the benefit of any increase in the value of the property by the time of the foreclosure sale. The increase would accrue to the benefit of the debtor, a result some of the parties describe as a \"windfall.\" We think, however, that the creditor's lien stays with the real property until the foreclosure. That is what was bargained for by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The voidness language sensibly applies only to the security aspect of the lien and then only to the real deficiency in the security. Any increase over the judicially determined valuation during bankruptcy rightly accrues to the benefit of the creditor, not to the benefit of the debtor and not to the benefit of other unsecured creditors whose claims have been allowed and who had nothing to do with the mortgagor-mortgagee bargain. Such surely would be the result had the lienholder stayed aloof from the bankruptcy proceeding (subject, of course, to      the power of other persons or entities to pull him into the proceeding pursuant to § 501), and we see no reason why his acquiescence in that proceeding should cause him to experience a forfeiture of the kind the debtor proposes. It is true that his participation in the bankruptcy results in his having the benefit of an allowed unsecured claim as well as his allowed secured claim, but that does not strike us as proper recompense for what petitioner proposes by way of the elimination of the remainder of the lien. 2. This result appears to have been clearly established before the passage of the 1978 Act. Under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, a lien on real property passed through bankruptcy unaffected. This Court recently acknowledged that this was so. See Farrey v. Sanderfoot, 500 U.S.    , 297 (1991) (\"Ordinarily, liens and other secured interests survive bankruptcy\"); Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U.S.   , 84 (1991) (\"Rather, a bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claimnamely, an action against the debtor in personam while leaving intact anothernamely, an action against the debtor in rem \").    3. Apart from reorganization proceedings, see 11 U.S.  . §§ 616(1) and (10) (1976 ed.), no provision of the pre-Code      statute permitted involuntary reduction of the amount of a creditor's lien for any reason other than payment on the debt. Our cases reveal the Court's concern about this. In Long v. Bullard, 117 U.S.    , 620-621 (1886), the Court held that a discharge in bankruptcy does not release real estate of the debtor from the lien of a mortgage created by him before the bankruptcy. And in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank  v. Radford, 295 U.S.     (1935), the Court considered additions to the Bankruptcy Act effected by the Frazier-Lemke Act, 48 Stat. 1289. There the Court noted that the latter Act's \"avowed object is to take from the mortgagee rights in the specific property held as security; and to that end `to scale down the indebtedness' to the present value of the property.\" 295 U.S., at    . The Court invalidated that statute under the Takings Clause. It further observed: \"No instance has been found, except under the Frazier-Lemke Act, of either a statute or decision compelling the mortgagee to relinquish the property to the mortgagor free of the lien unless the debt was paid in full.\" Id. , at 579. Congress must have enacted the Code with a full understanding of this practice. See H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 357 (1977) (\"Subsection (d) permits liens to pass through the bankruptcy case unaffected\"). 4. When Congress amends the bankruptcy laws, it does not write \"on a clean slate.\" See Emil v. Hanley, 318 U.S.    , 521 (1943). Furthermore, this Court has been reluctant to accept arguments that would interpret the Code, however vague the particular language under consideration might be, to effect a major change in pre-Code practice that is not the subject of at least some discussion in the legislative history. See United Savings Assn. of Texas v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U.S.    , 380 (1988). See also Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U.S.    , 563 (1990); United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U.S.    , 244-245 (1989). Of course, where the language is unambiguous, silence in the legislative history cannot      be controlling. But, given the ambiguity here, to attribute to Congress the intention to grant a debtor the broad new remedy against allowed claims to the extent that they become \"unsecured\" for purposes of § 506(a) without the new remedy's being mentioned somewhere in the Code itself or in the annals of Congress is not plausible, in our view, and is contrary to basic bankruptcy principles. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. It is so ordered.",
