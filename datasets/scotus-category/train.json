    "data": "\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court. This case presents, as it has from its inception in the\nUnited States District Court, a question of interpretation\nunder the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of In­\nternational Child Abduction (Convention), Oct. 24, 1980,\nT. I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99–11. The\nUnited States is a contracting state to the Convention; and\nCongress has implemented its provisions through the\nInternational Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 102\nStat. 437, 42 U. S. C. §11601 et seq. The Convention\nprovides that a child abducted in violation of “rights of\ncustody” must be returned to the child’s country of habit­\nual residence, unless certain exceptions apply. Art. 1, S.\nTreaty Doc. No. 99–11, at 7 (Treaty Doc.). The question is\nwhether a parent has a “righ[t] of custody” by reason of\nthat parent’s ne exeat right: the authority to consent before\nthe other parent may take the child to another country. \n   Timothy Abbott and Jacquelyn Vaye Abbott married in\nEngland in 1992. He is a British citizen, and she is a\ncitizen of the United States. Mr. Abbott’s astronomy\nprofession took the couple to Hawaii, where their son\nA. J. A. was born in 1995. The Abbotts moved to La\nSerena, Chile, in 2002. There was marital discord, and\nthe parents separated in March 2003. The Chilean courts\ngranted the mother daily care and control of the child,\nwhile awarding the father “direct and regular” visitation\nrights, including visitation every other weekend and for\nthe whole month of February each year. App. 9.\n Chilean law conferred upon Mr. Abbott what is com­\nmonly known as a ne exeat right: a right to consent before\nMs. Abbott could take A. J. A. out of Chile. See Minors\nLaw 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a\n(granting a ne exeat right to any parent with visitation\nrights). In effect a ne exeat right imposes a duty on one\nparent that is a right in the other. After Mr. Abbott ob­\ntained a British passport for A. J. A., Ms. Abbott grew\nconcerned that Mr. Abbott would take the boy to Britain. She sought and obtained a “ne exeat of the minor” order\nfrom the Chilean family court, prohibiting the boy from\nbeing taken out of Chile. \n  In August 2005, while proceedings before the Chilean\ncourt were pending, the mother removed the boy from\nChile without permission from either the father or the\ncourt. A private investigator located the mother and the\nchild in Texas. In February 2006, the mother filed for\ndivorce in Texas state court. Part of the relief she sought\nwas a modification of the father’s rights, including full\npower in her to determine the boy’s place of residence and\nan order limiting the father to supervised visitation in\nTexas. This litigation remains pending. Mr. Abbott brought an action in Texas state court,\nasking for visitation rights and an order requiring Ms.\nAbbott to show cause why the court should not allow Mr.\nAbbott to return to Chile with A. J. A. In February 2006,\nthe court denied Mr. Abbott’s requested relief but granted\nhim “liberal periods of possession” of A. J. A. throughout\nFebruary 2006, provided Mr. Abbott remained in Texas. App. 42.\n In May 2006, Mr. Abbott filed the instant action in the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of\nTexas. He sought an order requiring his son’s return to\nChile pursuant to the Convention and enforcement provi­\nsions of the ICARA. In July 2007, after holding a bench\ntrial during which only Mr. Abbott testified, the District\nCourt denied relief. The court held that the father’s ne\nexeat right did not constitute a right of custody under the\nConvention and, as a result, that the return remedy was\nnot authorized. 495 F. Supp. 2d 635, 640.\n \n    The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\naffirmed on the same rationale. The court held the father\npossessed no rights of custody under the Convention be­\ncause his ne exeat right was only “a veto right over his\nson’s departure from Chile.” 542 F. 3d 1081, 1087 (2008). The court expressed substantial agreement with the Court\nof Appeals for the Second Circuit in Croll v. Croll, 229\nF. 3d 133 (2000). Relying on American dictionary defini­\ntions of “custody” and noting that ne exeat rights cannot be\n“ ‘actually exercised’ ” within the meaning of the Conven­\ntion, Croll held that ne exeat rights are not rights of cus­\ntody. Id., at 138–141 (quoting Art. 3(b), Treaty Doc., at 7). A dissenting opinion in Croll was filed by then-Judge\nSotomayor. The dissent maintained that a ne exeat right\nis a right of custody because it “provides a parent with\ndecisionmaking authority regarding a child’s international\nrelocation.” 229 F. 3d, at 146.\n \n    The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits\nadopted the conclusion of the Croll majority. See Fawcett\nv. McRoberts, 326 F. 3d 491, 500 (CA4 2003); Gonzalez v.\nGutierrez, 311 F. 3d 942, 949 (CA9 2002). The Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit has followed the reason­\ning of the Croll dissent. Furnes v. Reeves, 362 F. 3d 702,\n720, n. 15 (2004). Certiorari was granted to resolve the\nconflict. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n \n  The Convention was adopted in 1980 in response to the\nproblem of international child abductions during domestic\ndisputes. The Convention seeks “to secure the prompt\nreturn of children wrongfully removed to or retained in\nany Contracting State,” and “to ensure that rights of\ncustody and of access under the law of one Contracting\nState are effectively respected in the other Contracting\nStates.” Art. 1, Treaty Doc., at 7.\n The provisions of the Convention of most relevance at\n\n\nthe outset of this discussion are as follows: \n    “Article 3: The removal or the retention of the child is\n    to be considered wrongful where—\n    “a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a\n    person, an institution or any other body, either jointly\n    or alone, under the law of the State in which the child\n    was habitually resident immediately before the re­\n    moval or retention; and\n    “b at the time of removal or retention those rights\n    were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or\n    would have been so exercised but for the removal or\n    retention. \n        .           .               .          .       .\n    “Article 5: For the purposes of this Convention—\n    “a ‘rights of custody’ shall include rights relating to\n    the care of the person of the child and, in particular,\n    the right to determine the child’s place of residence;\n    “b ‘rights of access’ shall include the right to take a\n    child for a limited period of time to a place other than\n    the child’s habitual residence. .           .               .          .       .\n    “Article 12: Where a child has been wrongfully re­\n    moved or retained in terms of Article 3 . . . the author­\n    ity concerned shall order the return of the child\n    forthwith.” Id., at 7, 9.\n \n   The Convention’s central operating feature is the return\nremedy. When a child under the age of 16 has been\nwrongfully removed or retained, the country to which the\nchild has been brought must “order the return of the child\nforthwith,” unless certain exceptions apply. See, e.g., Arts.\n4, 12, ibid. A removal is “wrongful” where the child was\nremoved in violation of “rights of custody.” The Conven­\ntion defines “rights of custody” to “include rights relating\nto the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the\nright to determine the child’s place of residence.” Art.\n5(a), id., at 7. A return remedy does not alter the pre-ab­\nduction allocation of custody rights but leaves custodial\ndecisions to the courts of the country of habitual residence. Art. 19, id., at 11. The Convention also recognizes “rights\nof access,” but offers no return remedy for a breach of\nthose rights. Arts. 5(b), 21, id., at 7, 11.\n \n   The United States has implemented the Convention\nthrough the ICARA. The statute authorizes a person who\nseeks a child’s return to file a petition in state or federal\ncourt and instructs that the court “shall decide the case in\naccordance with the Convention.” 42 U. S. C. §§11603(a),\n(b), (d). If the child in question has been “wrongfully\nremoved or retained within the meaning of the Conven­\ntion,” the child shall be “promptly returned,” unless an\nexception is applicable. §11601(a)(4).\n As the parties agree, the Convention applies to this\ndispute. A. J. A. is under 16 years old; he was a habitual\nresident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States\nare contracting states. The question is whether A. J. A.\nwas “wrongfully removed” from Chile, in other words,\nwhether he was removed in violation of a right of custody. This Court’s inquiry is shaped by the text of the Conven­\ntion; the views of the United States Department of State; decisions addressing the meaning of “rights of custody” in\ncourts of other contracting states; and the purposes of the\nConvention. After considering these sources, the Court\ndetermines that Mr. Abbott’s ne exeat right is a right of\ncustody under the Convention. \n  “The interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of\na statute, begins with its text.” Medellín v. Texas, 552\nU. S. 491, 506 (2008). This Court consults Chilean law to\ndetermine the content of Mr. Abbott’s right, while follow­\ning the Convention’s text and structure to decide whether\nthe right at issue is a “righ[t] of custody.” Chilean law granted Mr. Abbott a joint right to decide\nhis child’s country of residence, otherwise known as a\nne exeat right. Minors Law 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 61a, 62a, provides that “[o]nce the court has\ndecreed” that one of the parents has visitation rights, that\nparent’s “authorization . . . shall also be required” before\nthe child may be taken out of the country, subject to court\noverride only where authorization “cannot be granted or is\ndenied without good reason.” Mr. Abbott has “direct and\nregular” visitation rights and it follows from Chilean law,\nthat he has a shared right to determine his son’s country\nof residence under this provision. App. 9. To support the\nconclusion that Mr. Abbott’s right under Chilean law gives\nhim a joint right to decide his son’s country of residence, it\nis notable that a Chilean agency has explained that Mi­\nnors Law 16,618 is a “right to authorize the minors’ exit”\nfrom Chile and that this provision means that neither\nparent can “unilaterally” “establish the [child’s] place of\nresidence.” Letter from Paula Strap Camus, Director\nGeneral, Corporation of Judicial Assistance of the Region\nMetropolitana, to National Center for Missing and Ex­\nploited Children (Jan. 17, 2006), App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nVillegas Duran v. Arribada Beaumont, No. 08–775, pp.\n35a–37a, cert. pending. The Convention recognizes that custody rights can be\ndecreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3(a), Treaty Doc., at 7; and Mr. Abbott’s joint right to determine his son’s country\nof residence is best classified as a joint right of custody, as\nthe Convention defines that term. The Convention defines\n“rights of custody” to “include rights relating to the care of\nthe person of the child and, in particular, the right to\ndetermine the child’s place of residence.” Art. 5(a), ibid. Mr. Abbott’s ne exeat right gives him both the joint “right\nto determine the child’s place of residence” and joint\n“rights relating to the care of the person of the child.”\n Mr. Abbott’s joint right to decide A. J. A.’s country of\nresidence allows him to “determine the child’s place of\nresidence.” The phrase “place of residence” encompasses\nthe child’s country of residence, especially in light of the\nConvention’s explicit purpose to prevent wrongful removal\nacross international borders. See Convention Preamble,\nTreaty Doc., at 7. And even if “place of residence” refers\nonly to the child’s street address within a country, a\nne exeat right still entitles Mr. Abbott to “determine” that\nplace.  “[D]etermine” can mean “[t]o fix conclusively or\nauthoritatively,” Webster’s New International Dictionary\n711 (2d ed. 1954) (2d definition), but it can also mean “[t]o\nset bounds or limits to,” ibid. (1st definition), which is\nwhat Mr. Abbott’s ne exeat right allows by ensuring that\nA. J. A. cannot live at any street addresses outside of\nChile. It follows that the Convention’s protection of a\nparent’s custodial “right to determine the child’s place of\nresidence” includes a ne exeat right. Mr. Abbott’s joint right to determine A. J. A.’s country of\nresidence also gives him “rights relating to the care of the\nperson of the child.” Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. Few\ndecisions are as significant as the language the child\nspeaks, the identity he finds, or the culture and traditions\nshe will come to absorb. These factors, so essential to self­\ndefinition, are linked in an inextricable way to the child’s\ncountry of residence. One need only consider the different\nchildhoods an adolescent will experience if he or she grows\nup in the United States, Chile, Germany, or North Korea,\nto understand how choosing a child’s country of residence\nis a right “relating to the care of the person of the child.” The Court of Appeals described Mr. Abbott’s right to take\npart in making this decision as a mere “veto,” 542 F. 3d, at\n1087; but even by that truncated description, the father\nhas an essential role in deciding the boy’s country of resi­\ndence. For example, Mr. Abbott could condition his con­\nsent to a change in country on A. J. A.’s moving to a city\noutside Chile where Mr. Abbott could obtain an astronomy\nposition, thus allowing the father to have continued con­\ntact with the boy. \n   That a ne exeat right does not fit within traditional\nnotions of physical custody is beside the point. The Con­\nvention defines “rights of custody,” and it is that definition\nthat a court must consult. This uniform, text-based ap­\nproach ensures international consistency in interpreting\nthe Convention. It forecloses courts from relying on defi­\nnitions of custody confined by local law usage, definitions\nthat may undermine recognition of custodial arrange­\nments in other countries or in different legal traditions,\nincluding the civil-law tradition. And, in any case, our\nown legal system has adopted conceptions of custody that\naccord with the Convention’s broad definition. Joint legal\ncustody, in which one parent cares for the child while the\nother has joint decisionmaking authority concerning the\nchild’s welfare, has become increasingly common. See\nSinger, Dispute Resolution and the Postdivorce Family:\nImplications of a Paradigm Shift, 47 Family Ct. Rev. 363,\n366 (2009) (“[A] recent study of child custody outcomes in\nNorth Carolina indicated that almost 70% of all custody\nresolutions included joint legal custody, as did over 90% of\nall mediated custody agreements”); E. Maccoby & R.\nMnookin, Dividing the Child: Social and Legal Dilemmas\nof Custody 107 (1992) (“[F]or 79% of our entire sample, the\n[California] divorce decree provided for joint legal cus­\ntody”); see generally Elrod, Reforming the System to Pro­\ntect Children in High Conflict Custody Cases, 28 Wm.\nMitchell L. Rev. 495, 505–508 (2001). Ms. Abbott gets the analysis backwards in claiming that\na ne exeat right is not a right of custody because the Con­\nvention requires that any right of custody must be capable\nof exercise. The Convention protects rights of custody\nwhen “at the time of removal or retention those rights\nwere actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would\nhave been so exercised but for the removal or retention.” Art. 3(b), Treaty Doc., at 7. In cases like this one, a\nne exeat right is by its nature inchoate and so has no\noperative force except when the other parent seeks to\nremove the child from the country. If that occurs, the\nparent can exercise the ne exeat right by declining consent\nto the exit or placing conditions to ensure the move will be\nin the child’s best interests. When one parent removes the\nchild without seeking the ne exeat holder’s consent, it is an\ninstance where the right would have been “exercised but\nfor the removal or retention.” Ibid. \n   The Court of Appeals’ conclusion that a breach of a ne\nexeat right does not give rise to a return remedy would\nrender the Convention meaningless in many cases where\nit is most needed. The Convention provides a return\nremedy when a parent takes a child across international\nborders in violation of a right of custody. The Convention\nprovides no return remedy when a parent removes a child\nin violation of a right of access but requires contracting\nstates “to promote the peaceful enjoyment of access\nrights.” Art. 21, id., at 11. For example, a court may force\nthe custodial parent to pay the travel costs of visitation,\nsee, e.g., Viragh v. Foldes, 415 Mass. 96, 109–111, 612\nN. E. 2d 241, 249–250 (1993), or make other provisions for\nthe noncustodial parent to visit his or her child, see\n§11603(b) (authorizing petitions to “secur[e] the effective\nexercise of rights of access to a child”). But unlike rights\nof access, ne exeat rights can only be honored with a return\nremedy because these rights depend on the child’s location\nbeing the country of habitual residence. \n   Any suggestion that a ne exeat right is a “righ[t] of\naccess” is illogical and atextual. The Convention defines\n“rights of access” as “includ[ing] the right to take a child\nfor a limited period of time to a place other than the child’s\nhabitual residence,” Art. 5(b), Treaty Doc., at 7, and\nICARA defines that same term as “visitation rights,”\n§11602(7). The joint right to decide a child’s country of\nresidence is not even arguably a “right to take a child for a\nlimited period of time” or a “visitation righ[t].” Reaching\nthe commonsense conclusion that a ne exeat right does not\nfit these definitions of “rights of access” honors the Con­\nvention’s distinction between rights of access and rights of\ncustody. Ms. Abbott argues that the ne exeat order in this case\ncannot create a right of custody because it merely protects\na court’s jurisdiction over the child. Even if this argument\nwere correct, it would not be dispositive. Ms. Abbott\ncontends the Chilean court’s ne exeat order contains no\nparental consent provision and so awards the father no\nrights, custodial or otherwise. See Brief for Respondent\n22; but see 495 F. Supp. 2d, at 638, n. 3 (the District Court\ntreating the order as containing a consent provision); 542\nF. 3d, at 1084 (same for the Court of Appeals). Even a\nne exeat order issued to protect a court’s jurisdiction pend­\ning issuance of further decrees is consistent with allowing\na parent to object to the child’s removal from the country. This Court need not decide the status of ne exeat orders\nlacking parental consent provisions, however; for here the\nfather relies on his rights under Minors Law 16,618. Mr.\nAbbott’s rights derive not from the order but from Minors\nLaw 16,618. That law requires the father’s consent before\nthe mother can remove the boy from Chile, subject only to\nthe equitable power family courts retain to override any\njoint custodial arrangements in times of disagreement. Minors Law 16,618; see 1 J. Atkinson, Modern Child\nCustody Practice §6–11 (2d ed. 2009) (“[T]he court remains\nthe final arbiter and may resolve the [dispute between\njoint custodians] itself or designate one parent as having\nfinal authority on certain issues affecting the child”); Lombardo v. Lombardo, 202 Mich. App. 151, 159, 507\nN. W. 2d 788, 792 (1993) (“[W]here the parents as joint\ncustodians cannot agree on important matters such as\neducation, it is the court’s duty to determine the issue in\nthe best interests of the child”). The consent provision in\nMinors Law 16,618 confers upon the father the joint right\nto determine his child’s country of residence. This is a\nright of custody under the Convention. This Court’s conclusion that Mr. Abbott possesses a\nright of custody under the Convention is supported and\ninformed by the State Department’s view on the issue. The United States has endorsed the view that ne exeat\nrights are rights of custody. In its brief before this Court\nthe United States advises that “the Department of State,\nwhose Office of Children’s Issues serves as the Central\nAuthority for the United States under the Convention, has\nlong understood the Convention as including ne exeat\nrights among the protected ‘rights of custody.’ ” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 21; see Sumitomo Shoji\nAmerica, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 184–185, n. 10\n(1982) (deferring to the Executive’s interpretation of a\ntreaty as memorialized in a brief before this Court). It is\nwell settled that the Executive Branch’s interpretation of\na treaty “is entitled to great weight.” Id., at 185. There is\nno reason to doubt that this well-established canon of\ndeference is appropriate here. The Executive is well in­\nformed concerning the diplomatic consequences resulting\nfrom this Court’s interpretation of “rights of custody,”\nincluding the likely reaction of other contracting states\nand the impact on the State Department’s ability to re­\nclaim children abducted from this country. \n  This Court’s conclusion that ne exeat rights are rights of\ncustody is further informed by the views of other contract­\ning states. In interpreting any treaty, “[t]he ‘opinions of\nour sister signatories’ . . . are ‘entitled to considerable\nweight.’ ” El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng,\n525 U. S. 155, 176 (1999) (quoting Air France v. Saks, 470\nU. S. 392, 404 (1985)). The principle applies with special\nforce here, for Congress has directed that “uniform inter­\nnational interpretation of the Convention” is part of the\nConvention’s framework. See §11601(b)(3)(B).\n \n  A review of the international case law confirms broad\nacceptance of the rule that ne exeat rights are rights of\ncustody. In an early decision, the English High Court of\nJustice explained that a father’s “right to ensure that the\nchild remain[ed] in Australia or live[d] anywhere outside\nAustralia only with his approval” is a right of custody\nrequiring return of the child to Australia. C. v. C., [1989]\n1 W. L. R. 654, 658 (C. A.). Lords of the House of Lords\nhave agreed, noting that C. v. C.’s conclusion is “settled, so\nfar as the United Kingdom is concerned” and “appears to\nbe the majority [view] of the common law world.” See In\nre D (A Child), [2007] 1 A. C. 619, 628, 633, 635 (2006).\n The Supreme Court of Israel follows the same rule,\nconcluding that “the term ‘custody’ should be interpreted\nin an expansive way, so that it will apply [i]n every case in\nwhich there is a need for the consent of one of the parents\nto remove the children from one country to another.” CA\n5271/92 Foxman v. Foxman, [1992], §§3(D), 4 (K. Chagall\ntransl.). The High Courts of Austria, South Africa, and\nGermany are in accord. See Oberster Gerichtshof\n[O. G. H.] [Supreme Court] Feb. 5, 1992, 2 Ob 596/91\n(Austria) (“Since the English Custody Court had ordered\nthat the children must not be removed from England and\nWales without the father’s written consent, both parents\nhad, in effect, been granted joint custody concerning the\nchildren’s place of residence”); Sonderup v. Tondelli,\n2001(1) SA 1171, 1183 (Constitutional Ct. of South Africa\n2000) (“[The mother’s] failure to return to British Colum­\nbia with the child . . . was a breach of the conditions upon\nwhich she was entitled to exercise her rights of custody\nand . . . therefore constituted a wrongful retention . . . as\ncontemplated by [Article 3] of the Convention”); Bundes­\nverfassungsgericht [BVerfG] [Federal Constitutional\nCourt of Germany] July 18, 1997, 2 BvR 1126/97, ¶15 (the\nConvention requires a return remedy for a violation of the\n“right to have a say in the child’s place of residence”). Appellate courts in Australia and Scotland agree. See In\nthe Marriage of Resina [1991] FamCA 33 (Austl., May 22,\n1991), ¶¶18–27; A. J. v. F. J., [2005] CSIH 36, 2005 1 S. C.\n428, 435–436.\n \n   It is true that some courts have stated a contrary view,\nor at least a more restrictive one. The Canadian Supreme\nCourt has said ne exeat orders are “usually intended” to\nprotect access rights. Thomson v. Thomson, [1994] 3\nS. C. R. 551, 589–590, 119 D. L. R. (4th) 253, 281; see D. S.\nv. V. W., [1996] 2 S. C. R. 108, 134 D. L. R. (4th) 481. But\nthe Canadian cases are not precisely on point here. Thomson ordered a return remedy based on an interim\nne exeat order, and only noted in dicta that it may not\norder such a remedy pursuant to a permanent ne exeat\norder. See [1994] 3 S. C. R., at 589–590, 119 D. L. R. (4th),\nat 281. D. S. involved a parent’s claim based on an im­\nplicit ne exeat right and, in any event, the court ordered a\nreturn remedy on a different basis. See [1996] 2 S. C. R.,\nat 140–141, 142, 134 D. L. R. (4th), at 503–504, 505.\n \n   French courts are divided. A French Court of Appeals\nheld that “the right to accept or refuse the removal of the\nchildren’s residence” outside of a region was “a joint exer­\ncise of rights of custody.” Public Ministry v. M. B., [CA]\nAix-en-Provence, 6e ch., Mar. 23, 1989, Rev. crit. dr. inter­\nnat. Privé 79(3), July–Sept. 1990, 529, 533–535. A trial\ncourt in a different region of France rejected this view,\nrelying on the mother’s “fundamental liberty” to establish\nher domicil. See Attorney for the Republic at Périgueux v.\nMrs. S., [T. G. I.] Périgueux, Mar. 17, 1992, Rev. cr. dr.\ninternat. Privé 82(4) Oct.–Dec. 1993, 650, 651–653, note\nBertrand Ancel, D. 1992, note G. C. \n   Scholars agree that there is an emerging international\nconsensus that ne exeat rights are rights of custody, even if\nthat view was not generally formulated when the Conven­\ntion was drafted in 1980. At that time, joint custodial\narrangements were unknown in many of the contracting\nstates, and the status of ne exeat rights was not yet well\nunderstood. See 1980 Conférence de La Haye de droit\ninternational privé, Enlèvement d’enfants, morning meet­\ning of Wed., Oct. 8, 1980 (discussion by Messrs. Leal & van\nBoeschoten), in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quatorzième\nsession, pp. 263–266 (1982) (Canadian and Dutch dele­\ngates disagreeing whether the Convention protected\nne exeat rights, while agreeing that it should protect such\nrights). Since 1980, however, joint custodial arrange­\nments have become more common. See supra, at 8–9. And, within this framework, most contracting states and\nscholars now recognize that ne exeat rights are rights of\ncustody. See, e.g., Hague Conference on Private Interna­\ntional Law: Transfrontier Contact Concerning Children:\nGeneral Principles and Guide to Good Practice §9.3, p. 43\n(2008) (“[P]reponderance of the case law supports the\nview” that ne exeat rights are “rights of custody” (footnote\nomitted)); Hague Conference on Private International\nLaw: Overall Conclusions of the Special Commission of\nOct. 1989 on the Operation of the Hague Convention of 25\nOct. 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child\nAbduction, reprinted in 29 I.

Croll: The Second Circuit\nLimits “Custody Rights” Under the Hague Convention on\nthe Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 9\nTulane J. Int’l & Comp. L. 605, 611–616 (2001). \n   A history of the Convention, known as the Pérez-Vera\nReport, has been cited both by the parties and by Courts of\nAppeals that have considered this issue. See 1980 Con­\nférence de La Haye de droit international privé, Enlève­\nment d’enfants, E. Pérez-Vera, Explanatory Report (PérezVera Report or Report), in 3 Actes et Documents de la\nQuatorzième session, pp. 425–473 (1982). We need not\ndecide whether this Report should be given greater weight\nthan a scholarly commentary. Compare Hague Interna­\ntional Child Abduction Convention; Text and Legal Analy­\nsis, 51 Fed. Reg. 10503–10506 (1986) (identifying the\nReport as the “official history” of the Convention and “a\nsource of background on the meaning of the provisions of\nthe Convention”), with Pérez-Vera Report ¶8, at 427–428\n(“[the Report] has not been approved by the Conference,\nand it is possible that, despite the Rapporter’s [sic] efforts\nto remain objective, certain passages reflect a viewpoint\nwhich is in part subjective”). It suffices to note that the\nReport supports the conclusion that ne exeat rights are\nrights of custody. The Report explains that rather than\ndefining custody in precise terms or referring to the laws\nof different nations pertaining to parental rights, the\nConvention uses the unadorned term “rights of custody” to\nrecognize “all the ways in which custody of children can be\nexercised” through “a flexible interpretation of the terms\nused, which allows the greatest possible number of cases\nto be brought into consideration.” Id., ¶¶67, 71, at 446,\n447–448. Thus the Report rejects the notion that because\nne exeat rights do not encompass the right to make medi­\ncal or some other important decisions about a child’s life\nthey cannot be rights of custody. Indeed, the Report is\nfully consistent with the conclusion that ne exeat rights\nare just one of the many “ways in which custody of chil­\ndren can be exercised.” Id., ¶ 71, at 447.\n \n   Adopting the view that the Convention provides a re­\nturn remedy for violations of ne exeat rights accords with\nits objects and purposes. The Convention is based on the\nprinciple that the best interests of the child are well\nserved when decisions regarding custody rights are made\nin the country of habitual residence. See Convention\nPreamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. Ordering a return remedy\ndoes not alter the existing allocation of custody rights, Art.\n19, id., at 11, but does allow the courts of the home coun­\ntry to decide what is in the child’s best interests. It is the\nConvention’s premise that courts in contracting states will\nmake this determination in a responsible manner. \n   Custody decisions are often difficult. Judges must strive\nalways to avoid a common tendency to prefer their own\nsociety and culture, a tendency that ought not interfere\nwith objective consideration of all the factors that should\nbe weighed in determining the best interests of the child. This judicial neutrality is presumed from the mandate of\nthe Convention, which affirms that the contracting states\nare “[f]irmly convinced that the interests of children are of\nparamount importance in matters relating to their cus­\ntody.” Convention Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. Interna­\ntional law serves a high purpose when it underwrites\nthe determination by nations to rely upon their domes­\ntic courts to enforce just laws by legitimate and fair\nproceedings. \n   To interpret the Convention to permit an abducting\nparent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other\nparent holds a ne exeat right, would run counter to the\nConvention’s purpose of deterring child abductions by\nparents who attempt to find a friendlier forum for deciding\ncustodial disputes. Ms. Abbott removed A. J. A. from\nChile while Mr. Abbott’s request to enhance his relation­\nship with his son was still pending before Chilean courts. After she landed in Texas, the mother asked the state\ncourt to diminish or eliminate the father’s custodial and\nvisitation rights. The Convention should not be inter­\npreted to permit a parent to select which country will\nadjudicate these questions by bringing the child to a dif­\nferent country, in violation of a ne exeat right. Denying a\nreturn remedy for the violation of such rights would “le­\ngitimize the very action—removal of the child—that the\nhome country, through its custody order [or other provi­\nsion of law], sought to prevent” and would allow “parents\nto undermine the very purpose of the Convention.” Croll,\n229 F. 3d, at 147 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). This Court\nshould be most reluctant to adopt an interpretation that\ngives an abducting parent an advantage by coming here to\navoid a return remedy that is granted, for instance, in the\nUnited Kingdom, Israel, Germany, and South Africa. See\nsupra, at 12–13.\n \n   Requiring a return remedy in cases like this one helps\ndeter child abductions and respects the Convention’s\npurpose to prevent harms resulting from abductions. An\nabduction can have devastating consequences for a child. \n“Some child psychologists believe that the trauma children\nsuffer from these abductions is one of the worst forms of\nchild abuse.” H. R. Rep. No. 103–390, p. 2 (1993). A child\nabducted by one parent is separated from the second\nparent and the child’s support system. Studies have\nshown that separation by abduction can cause psychologi­\ncal problems ranging from depression and acute stress\ndisorder to posttraumatic stress disorder and identity­\nformation issues. See N. Faulkner, Parental Child Abduc­\ntion is Child Abuse (1999), http://www.prevent-abuse­\nnow.com/unreport.htm (as visited May 13, 2010, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file). A child abducted at\nan early age can experience loss of community and stabil­\nity, leading to loneliness, anger, and fear of abandonment. See Huntington, Parental Kidnapping: A New Form of\nChild Abuse (1982), in American Prosecutors Research\nInstitute’s National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse,\nParental Abduction Project, Investigation and Prosecution\nof Parental Abduction (1995) (App. A). Abductions may\nprevent the child from forming a relationship with the left­\nbehind parent, impairing the child’s ability to mature. See\nFaulkner, supra, at 5.\n \n   While a parent possessing a ne exeat right has a right of\ncustody and may seek a return remedy, a return order is\nnot automatic. Return is not required if the abducting\nparent can establish that a Convention exception applies. One exception states return of the child is not required\nwhen “there is a grave risk that his or her return would\nexpose the child to physical or psychological harm or\notherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.” Art.\n13(b), Treaty Doc., at 10. If, for example, Ms. Abbott could\ndemonstrate that returning to Chile would put her own\nsafety at grave risk, the court could consider whether this\nis sufficient to show that the child too would suffer “psy­\nchological harm” or be placed “in an intolerable situation.” See, e.g., Baran v. Beaty, 526 F. 3d 1340, 1352–1353\n(CA11 2008); Walsh v. Walsh, 221 F. 3d 204, 220–221\n(CA1 2000). The Convention also allows courts to decline\nto order removal if the child objects, if the child has\nreached a sufficient “age and degree of maturity at which\nit is appropriate to take account of its views.” Art. 13(b),\nTreaty Doc., at 10. The proper interpretation and applica­\ntion of these and other exceptions are not before this\nCourt. These matters may be addressed on remand. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion. \n                                        It is so ordered.\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n",

    "data": "Justice O'Connor, delivered the opinion of the Court. Today we construe three provisions of the federal firearms statutes: \"It shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted . . . [of] a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . [to possess] any firearm . . . .\" 18 U. S. C. § 922(g). \"What constitutes a conviction . . . shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.\"  § 921(a)(20) (the choice-oflaw clause). \"Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction . . . .\" Ibid. (the exemption clause). The question before us is which jurisdiction's law is to be considered in determining whether a felon \"has had civil rights restored\" for a prior federal conviction. Each of the petitioners was convicted of violating § 922(g). Beecham was convicted in Federal District Court in North Carolina, Jones in Federal District Court in West Virginia. Beecham's relevant prior conviction was a 1979 federal conviction in Tennessee, for violating 18 U. S. C. § 922(h). App. 11. Jones' prior convictions were two West Virginia state convictions, for breaking and entering and for forgery, and one 1971 federal conviction in Ohio for interstate transportation of a stolen automobile. Id., at 19-20. Jones had gotten his civil rights restored by West Virginia, so his two West Virginia state convictions were not considered. Beecham claimed his civil rights had been restored by Tennessee, the State in which he had been convicted of his federal offense. The question presented to the District Courts was whether these restorations of civil rights by States could remove the disabilities imposed as a result of Beecham's and Jones' federal convictions. In both cases, the District Courts concluded the answer was \"yes,\" though for different reasons: In Beecham's case the court looked to the law of the State in which the earlier federal crime was committed (Tennessee); in Jones' case the court looked to the law of the State in which Jones lived when he committed the § 922(g) offense (West Virginia). The Fourth Circuit reversed both rulings, reasoning that state restoration of civil rights could not undo the federal disability flowing from a federal conviction. See 993 F. 2d 1131 (1993) (Jones' case) and 993 F. 2d 1539 (1993) (judgt. order in Beecham's case). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict this decision created with United States v. Edwards, 946 F. 2d 1347 (CA8 1991), and United States v. Geyler, 932 F. 2d 1330 (CA9 1991). 510 U. S. 975 (1993). The question in these cases is how the choice-of-law clause and the exemption clause of § 921(a)(20) are related. If, as      the Fourth Circuit held, the choice-of-law clause applies to the exemption clause, then we must look to whether Beecham's and Jones' civil rights were restored under federal law (the law of the jurisdiction in which the earlier proceedings were held). On the other hand, if, as the Eighth and Ninth Circuits concluded, the two clauses ought to be read separately, see Geyler, supra, at 1334-1335; Edwards, supra, at 1349-1350, then we would have to come up with a special choice-of-law principle for the exemption clause. We think the Fourth Circuit's reading is the better one. Throughout the statutory scheme, the inquiry is: Does the person have a qualifying conviction on his record? Section 922(g) imposes a disability on people who \"ha[ve] been convicted.\" The choice-of-law clause defines the rule for determining \"[w]hat constitutes a conviction.\" The exemption clause says that a conviction for which a person has had civil rights restored \"shall not be considered a conviction.\" Asking whether a person has had civil rights restored is thus just one step in determining whether something should \"be considered a conviction.\" By the terms of the choice-of-law clause, this determination is governed by the law of the convicting jurisdiction. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the other three procedures listed in the exemption clausepardons, expungements, and set-asidesare either always or almost always (depending on whether one considers a federal grant of habeas corpus to be a \"set-aside,\" a question we do not now decide) done by the jurisdiction of conviction. That several items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as well. Dole v. Steelworkers, 494 U. S. 26, 36 (1990); Third Nat. Bank in Nashville v. Impac Limited, Inc., 432 U. S. 312, 322 (1977); Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961). Though this canon of construction is by no means a hard and fast rule, it is a factor pointing toward the Fourth Circuit's construction of the statute.      In light of the statutory structure, the fact that both clauses speak of \"conviction[s]\" rebuts the Eighth and Ninth Circuits' argument that the two clauses \"pertain to two entirely different sets of circumstances\"\"the question of what constitutes a conviction\" and \"the effect of postconviction events.\" Geyler, supra, at 1334-1335; see also Edwards, supra, at 1349. The exemption clause does not simply say that a person whose civil rights have been restored is exempted from § 922(g)'s firearms disqualification. It says that the person's conviction \"shall not be considered a conviction.\" The effect of postconviction events is therefore, under the statutory scheme, just one element of the question of what constitutes a conviction. Likewise, the presence of the choice-of-law clause rebuts the Eighth and Ninth Circuits' argument that the \"plain, unlimited language,\" Edwards, supra, at 1349; see also Geyler, supra, at 1334, of the exemption clausewith its reference to \"[a]ny conviction . . . for which a person has . . . had civil rights restored\" (emphasis added)refers to all civil rights restorations, even those by a jurisdiction other than the one in which the conviction was entered. Regardless of what the quoted phrase might mean standing alone, in conjunction with the choice-of-law clause it must refer only to restorations of civil rights by the convicting jurisdiction. The plain meaning that we seek to discern is the plain meaning of the whole statute, not of isolated sentences. See King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991); Massachusetts  v. Morash, 490 U. S. 107, 115 (1989); Shell Oil Co. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue, 488 U. S. 19, 26 (1988). We are also unpersuaded by the Ninth Circuit's argument that \"[b]ecause there is no federal procedure for restoring civil rights to a federal felon, Congress could not have expected that the federal government would perform this function,\" and that therefore \"[t]he reference in § 921(a)(20) to the restoration of civil rights must be to the state procedure.\" Geyler, 932 F. 2d, at 1333. This reasoning assumes that Congress intended felons convicted by all jurisdictions to have access to all the procedures (pardon, expungement, set-aside, and civil rights restoration) specified in the exemption clause; but nothing in § 921(a)(20) supports the assumption on which this reasoning is based. Many jurisdictions have no procedure for restoring civil rights. See Apps. A and B to Brief for Petitioners (indicating that at least 11 StatesArkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia suspend felons' civil rights but provide no procedure for restoring them); see, e. g., Mo. Rev. Stat. § 561.026 (1979 and Supp. 1994); United States v. Thomas, 991 F. 2d 206, 213-214 (CA5) (Texas law), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 1014 (1993). However one reads the statutory schemeas looking to the law of the convicting jurisdiction, or to the law of the State in which the prior conduct took place, or to the law of the State in which the felon now lives or has at one time livedpeople in some jurisdictions would have options open to them that people in other jurisdictions may lack. Under our reading of the statute, a person convicted in federal court is no worse off than a person convicted in a court of a State that does not restore civil rights.      Because the statutory language is unambiguous, the rule of lenity, which petitioners urge us to employ here, is inapplicable. See Chapman v. United States, 500 U. S. 453, 463 464 (1991). Of course, by denying the existence of an ambiguity, we do not claim to be perfectly certain that we have divined Congress' intentions as to this particular situation. It is possible that the phrases on which our reading of the statute turns\"[w]hat constitutes a conviction\" and \"shall not be considered a conviction\"were accidents of statutory drafting; it is possible that some legislators thought the two sentences of § 921(a)(20) should be read separately, or, more likely, that they never considered the matter at all. And we recognize that in enacting the choice-of-law clause, legislators may have been simply responding to our decision in Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U. S. 103 (1983), which held that federal law rather than state law controls the definition of what constitutes a conviction, not setting forth a choice-of-law principle for the restoration of civil rights following a conviction. But our task is not the hopeless one of ascertaining what the legislators who passed the law would have decided had they reconvened to consider petitioners' particular cases. Rather, it is to determine whether the language the legislators actually enacted has a plain, unambiguous meaning. In this instance, we believe it does. We therefore conclude that petitioners can take advantage of § 921(a)(20) only if they have had their civil rights restored under federal law, and accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. So ordered.",

    "data": "MR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court. This suit was brought in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Michigan, by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of Labor, to enjoin petitioners from violating the maximum hours provisions    of the Fair Labor      Standards Act of 1938. 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C. § 201, et seq. Petitioners are two of four partners doing business as F.J. Boutell Service Company, the other two not being subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court. The four partners are the sole stockholders of the F.J. Boutell Drive-Away Company, a Michigan corporation, engaged in the transportation of automobiles and army equipment in interstate commerce. The employees of the Service Company involved in this suit are mechanics engaged in greasing, repairing, servicing and maintaining the transportation equipment owned and operated by the Drive-Away Company. The parties have stipulated and the trial court has found that the Service Company is engaged exclusively in rendering such service to the Drive-Away Company and such corporation \"is an entity separate and distinct from\" the Service Company. The case presents two questions: (1) whether the employees of the Service Company are \"engaged in any retail or service establishment the greater part of whose selling or servicing is in intrastate commerce\" within the meaning of the exemption clause, § 13 (a) (2);  and (2) whether they come within the exemption clause, § 13 (b) (1), which exempts from § 7    of the Act \"any employee with respect to whom the Interstate Commerce Commission has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section 204        of the Motor Carrier Act, 1935.\" 52 Stat. 1068, 29 U.S.C. § 213 (b) (1). The District Court ruled against petitioners on both questions and granted the injunction sought by the Administrator. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed on both grounds. 148 F.2d 329. We agree with those conclusions. The amended findings of fact agreed to by the parties include the statement that the petitioners' employees \"involved in this proceeding are mechanics engaged in greasing, repairing, servicing and maintaining the transportation equipment owned and operated by the F.J. Boutell Drive-Away Company . . .\" No claim is made that these employees are not engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of § 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act. They are well within the requirement that they be \"actually in or so closely related to the movement of the commerce as to be a part of it.\" McLeod v. Threlkeld, 319 U.S. 491, 497.         In answer to the first question, the record shows that these employees do not come within the exemption stated in § 13 (a) (2). This is so because their employer, the Service Company, supplies its services, including their services, exclusively to the Drive-Away Company which in turn uses those services in interstate commerce. The Drive-Away Company does not use their services for its own purposes as an ultimate consumer, beyond the end of the flow of goods in interstate commerce. Accordingly, the employees of the Service Company are not engaged in a retail or service establishment within the meaning of § 13 (a) (2) as interpreted in Roland Electrical Co. v. Walling, 326 U.S. 657, and Martino v. Michigan Window Cleaning Co., 327 U.S. 173. Furthermore, substantially all of the servicing done by the Service Company is thus done in interstate commerce, whereas § 13 (a) (2) requires the greater part of it to be done in intrastate commerce if the employees rendering it are to be exempted under that provision. The question whether the employees of the Service Company are to be exempted by virtue of § 13 (b) (1) turns upon whether the Interstate Commerce Commission has the \"power to establish\" maximum hours of service for them under § 204 (a) (1), (2) or (3) of the Motor Carrier Act, 1935,    now officially cited as Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 54 Stat. 919, 49 U.S.C. § 301, et seq. Whatever may be the precise scope of the Commission's \"power to establish\" hours of service, we hold that the Commission does not have that power over the men here concerned because the Commission's jurisdiction is limited to employees of \"carriers\" and the record here shows that the men in question are employees of the Service Company, which is not a carrier, rather than of the Drive-Away Company, which is a carrier. This is      true although the work these employees do is all supplied to the Drive-Away Company through the Service Company. The Wage and Hour Division has found to its satisfaction the facts necessary to place these employees of the Service Company under its jurisdiction for the purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The record contains no suggestion that the Interstate Commerce Commission or any other administrative body has found that these employees of the Service Company are or should be treated as employees of the Drive-Away Company for the purposes of the Interstate Commerce Act. This case, therefore, is decided upon the basis that the parties have stipulated and the trial court has found that these employees are employees of the partnership, the Service Company, which is the relationship established for them by the petitioners as their employers. See Schenley Distillers Corp. v. United States, 326 U.S. 432, for a case giving effect to certain other consequences under the Motor Carrier Act of a corporate arrangement chosen by the persons concerned as a means of carrying on their business. See also Higgins v. Smith, 308 U.S. 473, 477, for a different result under other circumstances. In the absence of power in the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish the maximum hours of service of these employees, the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act as to their maximum hours of employment remain applicable to them. It appears from the face of the Motor Carrier Act that § 204 refers only to the regulation of \"carriers.\" Moreover, Section 226 of the Act (formerly numbered 225, 54 Stat. 929, 49 U.S.C. § 325), which authorizes investigations by the Commission as a basis for the regulation of the maximum hours of service of employees under § 204, refers only to investigations of the \"maximum hours of      service of employees of all motor carriers and private carriers of property by motor vehicle . . .\"    The legislative history of the section is reviewed in United States v. American Trucking Assns., 310 U.S. 534, 544-550. The Interstate Commerce Commission has written many decisions defining the limits of its authority to prescribe      qualifications and maximum hours of service for employees of motor carriers under § 204 (a) (1), (2) and (3), but throughout these decisions it apparently has assumed that its jurisdiction is limited to employees of \"carriers\" which in turn are under the jurisdiction of the Commission. It has, for example, recognized its power to establish maximum hours of service for automobile maintenance mechanics of \"carriers\"    but at the same time has said  \"By far the larger proportion of the carriers subject to our jurisdiction operate less than 10 vehicles and do not employ mechanics to repair their vehicles, but on the contrary have such work done in commercial garages. We have, of course, no jurisdiction over employees working in commercial garages.\" (Italics supplied.) Ex parte No. MC-2, In the Matter of Maximum Hours of Service of Motor Carrier Employees, 28 M.C.C. 125, 132. The Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor has interpreted § 13 (b) (1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act consistently with the interpretation given to it by the Interstate Commerce      Commission. The interpretation of this Act by each of these agencies is entitled to great weight. United States v. American Trucking Assns., 310 U.S. 534, 549. Throughout the discussion of these sections by this Court in United States v. American Trucking Assns., supra, and in Southland Gasoline Co. v. Bayley, 319 U.S. 44, it is assumed that they refer to employees of \"carriers\" and of \"motor vehicle operators\" which are themselves under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and there is nothing in either case to indicate an interpretation by this Court that the exemption prescribed in § 13 (b) (1) extends to workers whose services affect the safety of operations of motor vehicle carriers but who are not themselves employees of a carrier. In this view of this case, it is not necessary to determine what kind of a carrier the Drive-Away Company is or even whether it is a carrier within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act because the employees involved in this case are not its employees. Similarly, it is not necessary to determine which of the employees of the Service Company do work which affects the safety of the operation      of motor vehicles because that classification applies to employees whose hours are regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission and not to those whose hours are regulated by the Fair Labor Standards Act. For these reasons we find that petitioners' employees come within the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and not within the exemptions stated in either § 13 (a) (2) or § 13 (b) (1) of that Act, and the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, therefore, is Affirmed.",

    "data": "    MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court. This case concerns the tax treatment to be accorded certain transactions in commodity futures. In the Tax Court, petitioner Corn Products Refining Company contended that its purchases and sales of corn futures in 1940 and 1942 were capital-asset transactions under § 117 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. It further contended that its futures transactions came within the \"wash sales\" provisions of § 118. The 1940 claim was disposed of on the ground that § 118 did not apply, but for the year 1942 both the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 215 F.2d    , held that the futures were not capital assets under § 117. We granted certiorari, 348 U.S.    ,    because of an asserted conflict with holdings in the Courts of Appeal for the Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits. Since we hold that these futures do not constitute capital assets in petitioner's hands, we do not reach the issue of whether the transactions were \"wash sales.\"     Petitioner is a nationally known manufacturer of products made from grain corn. It manufactures starch, syrup, sugar, and their byproducts, feeds and oil. Its average yearly grind of raw corn during the period 1937 through 1942 varied from thirty-five to sixty million bushels. Most of its products were sold under contracts requiring shipment in thirty days at a set price or at market price on the date of delivery, whichever was lower. It permitted cancellation of such contracts, but from experience it could calculate with some accuracy future orders that would remain firm. While it also sold to a few customers on long-term contracts involving substantial orders, these had little effect on the transactions here involved. In 1934 and again in 1936 droughts in the corn belt caused a sharp increase in the price of spot corn. With a storage capacity of only 2,300,000 bushels of corn, a bare three weeks' supply, Corn Products found itself unable to buy at a price which would permit its refined corn sugar, cerelose, to compete successfully with cane and beet sugar. To avoid a recurrence of this situation, petitioner, in 1937, began to establish a long position in corn futures \"as a part of its corn buying program\" and \"as the most economical method of obtaining an adequate supply of raw corn\" without entailing the expenditure of large sums for additional storage facilities. At harvest time each year it would buy futures when the price appeared favorable. It would take delivery on such contracts as it found necessary to its manufacturing operations and sell the remainder in early summer if no shortage was imminent. If shortages appeared, however, it sold futures only as it bought spot corn for grinding. In this manner it reached a balanced position with reference to any increase in spot corn prices. It made no effort to protect itself against a decline in prices. In 1940 it netted a profit of $680,587.39 in corn futures, but in 1942 it suffered a loss of $109,969.38. In computing its tax liability Corn Products reported these figures as ordinary profit and loss from its manufacturing operations for the respective years. It now contends that its futures were \"capital assets\" under § 117 and that gains and losses therefrom should have been treated as arising from the sale of a capital asset. In support of this position it claims that its futures trading was separate and apart from its manufacturing operations and that in its futures transactions it was acting as a \"legitimate capitalist.\" United States v. New York Coffee & Sugar Exchange, 263 U.S.    , 619. It denies that its futures transactions were \"hedges\" or \"speculative\" dealings as     covered by the ruling of General Counsel's Memorandum 17322, XV-2 Cum. Bull. 151, and claims that it is in truth \"the forgotten man\" of that administrative interpretation. Both the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals found petitioner's futures transactions to be an integral part of its business designed to protect its manufacturing operations against a price increase in its principal raw material and to assure a ready supply for future manufacturing requirements. Corn Products does not level a direct attack on these two-court findings but insists that its futures were \"property\" entitled to capital-asset treatment under § 117 and as such were distinct from its manufacturing business. We cannot agree. We find nothing in this record to support the contention that Corn Products' futures activity was separate and apart from its manufacturing operation. On the contrary, it appears that the transactions were vitally important to the company's business as a form of insurance against increases in the price of raw corn. Not only were the purchases initiated for just this reason, but the petitioner's sales policy, selling in the future at a fixed price or less, continued to leave it exceedingly vulnerable to rises in the price of corn. Further, the purchase of corn futures assured the company a source of supply which was admittedly cheaper than constructing additional storage facilities for raw corn. Under these facts it is difficult to imagine a program more closely geared to a company's manufacturing enterprise or more important to its successful operation. Likewise the claim of Corn Products that it was dealing in the market as a \"legitimate capitalist\" lacks support in the record. There can be no quarrel with a manufacturer's desire to protect itself against increasing costs of raw materials. Transactions which provide such protection are considered a legitimate form of insurance. United States v. New York Coffee & Sugar Exchange, 263     U. S., at 619; Browne v. Thorn, 260 U.S.    , 139-140. However, in labeling its activity as that of a \"legitimate capitalist\" exercising \"good judgment\" in the futures market, petitioner ignores the testimony of its own officers that in entering that market the company was \"trying to protect a part of [its] manufacturing costs\"; that its entry was not for the purpose of \"speculating and buying and selling corn futures\" but to fill an actual \"need for the quantity of corn [bought] . . . in order to cover . . . what [products] we expected to market over a period of fifteen or eighteen months.\" It matters not whether the label be that of \"legitimate capitalist\" or \"speculator\"; this is not the talk of the capital investor but of the far-sighted manufacturer. For tax purposes petitioner's purchases have been found to \"constitute an integral part of its manufacturing business\" by both the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals, and on essentially factual questions the findings of two courts should not ordinarily be disturbed. Comstock v. Group of Investors, 335 U.S.    , 214. Petitioner also makes much of the conclusion by both the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals that its transactions did not constitute \"true hedging.\" It is true that Corn Products did not secure complete protection from its market operations. Under its sales policy petitioner could not guard against a fall in prices. It is clear, however, that petitioner feared the possibility of a price rise more than that of a price decline. It therefore purchased partial insurance against its principal risk, and hoped to retain sufficient flexibility to avoid serious losses on a declining market. Nor can we find support for petitioner's contention that hedging is not within the exclusions of § 117 (a). Admittedly, petitioner's corn futures do not come within the literal language of the exclusions set out in that section. They were not stock in trade, actual inventory,     property held for sale to customers or depreciable property used in a trade or business. But the capital-asset provision of § 117 must not be so broadly applied as to defeat rather than further the purpose of Congress. Burnet v. Harmel, 287 U.S.    , 108. Congress intended that profits and losses arising from the everyday operation of a business be considered as ordinary income or loss rather than capital gain or loss. The preferential treatment provided by § 117 applies to transactions in property which are not the normal source of business income. It was intended \"to relieve the taxpayer from . . . excessive tax burdens on gains resulting from a conversion of capital investments, and to remove the deterrent effect of those burdens on such conversions.\" Burnet v. Harmel, 287 U. S., at 106. Since this section is an exception from the normal tax requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, the definition of a capital asset must be narrowly applied and its exclusions interpreted broadly. This is necessary to effectuate the basic congressional purpose. This Court has always construed narrowly the term \"capital assets\" in § 117. See Hort v. Commissioner, 313 U.S.   , 31; Kieselbach v. Commissioner, 317 U.S.    , 403. The problem of the appropriate tax treatment of hedging transactions first arose under the 1934 Tax Code revision. Thereafter the Treasury issued G. C. M. 17322, supra, distinguishing speculative transactions in commodity futures from hedging transactions. It held that hedging transactions were essentially to be regarded as insurance rather than a dealing in capital assets and that     gains and losses therefrom were ordinary business gains and losses. The interpretation outlined in this memorandum has been consistently followed by the courts as well as by the Commissioner. While it is true that this Court has not passed on its validity, it has been well recognized for 20 years; and Congress has made no change in it though the Code has been re-enacted on three subsequent occasions. This bespeaks congressional approval. Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U.S.   , 83. Furthermore, Congress has since specifically recognized the hedging exception here under consideration in the short-sale rule of § 1233 (a) of the 1954 Code. We believe that the statute clearly refutes the contention of Corn Products. Moreover, it is significant to note that practical considerations lead to the same conclusion. To hold otherwise would permit those engaged in hedging transactions to transmute ordinary income into capital     gain at will. The hedger may either sell the future and purchase in the spot market or take delivery under the future contract itself. But if a sale of the future created a capital transaction while delivery of the commodity under the same future did not, a loophole in the statute would be created and the purpose of Congress frustrated. The judgment is Affirmed.",

    "data": "Justice Ginsburg, delivered the opinion of the Court. This case concerns a standard form franchise agreement for the operation of a Subway sandwich shop in Montana.      When a dispute arose between parties to the agreement, franchisee Paul Casarotto sued franchisor Doctor's Associates, Inc. (DAI), and DAI's Montana development agent, Nick Lombardi, in a Montana state court. DAI and Lombardi sought to stop the litigation pending arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause set out on page nine of the franchise agreement. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) declares written provisions for arbitration \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\" 9 U. S. C. § 2. Montana law, however, declares an arbitration clause unenforceable unless \"[n]otice that [the] contract is subject to arbitration\" is \"typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of the contract.\" Mont. Code Ann. § 27-5114(4) (1995). The question here presented is whether Montana's law is compatible with the federal Act. We hold that Montana's first-page notice requirement, which governs not \"any contract,\" but specifically and solely contracts \"subject to arbitration,\" conflicts with the FAA and is therefore displaced by the federal measure. Petitioner DAI is the national franchisor of Subway sandwich shops. In April 1988, DAI entered a franchise agreement with respondent Paul Casarotto, which permitted Casarotto to open a Subway shop in Great Falls, Montana. The franchise agreement stated, on page nine and in ordinary type: \"Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract or the breach thereof shall be settled by Arbitration . . . .\" App. 75. In October 1992, Casarotto sued DAI and its agent, Nick Lombardi, in Montana state court, alleging state-law contract and tort claims relating to the franchise agreement. DAI demanded arbitration of those claims, and successfully moved in the Montana trial court to stay the lawsuit pending arbitration. Id., at 10-11.      The Montana Supreme Court reversed. Casarotto v. Lombardi, 268 Mont. 369, 886 P. 2d 931 (1994). That court left undisturbed the trial court's findings that the franchise agreement fell within the scope of the FAA and covered the claims Casarotto stated against DAI and Lombardi. The Montana Supreme Court held, however, that Mont. Code Ann. § 27-5114(4) rendered the agreement's arbitration clause unenforceable. The Montana statute provides: \"Notice that a contract is subject to arbitration .. . shall be typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of the contract; and unless such notice is displayed thereon, the contract may not be subject to arbitration.\" Notice of the arbitration clause in the franchise agreement did not appear on the first page of the contract. Nor was anything relating to the clause typed in underlined capital letters. Because the State's statutory notice requirement had not been met, the Montana Supreme Court declared the parties' dispute \"not subject to arbitration.\" 268 Mont., at 382, 886 P. 2d, at 939. DAI and Lombardi unsuccessfully argued before the Montana Supreme Court that § 27-5114(4) was preempted by § 2 of the FAA.    DAI and Lombardi dominantly relied on our decisions in Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1 (1984), and Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483 (1987). In Southland,  we held that § 2 of the FAA applies in state as well as federal courts, see 465 U. S., at 12, and \"withdr[aws] the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration,\" id., at 10. We noted in the pathmarking South-      land decision that the FAA established a \"broad principle of enforceability,\" id., at 11, and that § 2 of the federal Act provided for revocation of arbitration agreements only upon \"grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\" In Perry, we reiterated: \"[S]tate law, whether of legislative or judicial origin, is applicable if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally. A state-law principle that takes its meaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue does not comport with [the text of § 2].\" 482 U. S., at 493, n. 9. The Montana Supreme Court, however, read our decision in Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468 (1989), as limiting the preemptive force of § 2 and correspondingly qualifying Southland and Perry. 268 Mont., at 378-381, 886 P. 2d, at 937-939. As the Montana Supreme Court comprehended Volt, the proper inquiry here should focus not on the bare words of § 2, but on this question: Would the application of Montana's notice requirement, contained in § 27-5114(4), \"undermine the goals and policies of the FAA.\" 268 Mont., at 381, 886 P. 2d, at 938 (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 27-5114(4), in the Montana court's judgment, did not undermine the goals and policies of the FAA, for the notice requirement did not preclude arbitration agreements altogether; it simply prescribed \"that before arbitration agreements are enforceable, they be entered knowingly.\" Id., at 381, 886 P. 2d, at 939. DAI and Lombardi petitioned for certiorari. Last Term, we granted their petition, vacated the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court, and remanded for further consideration in light of Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265 (1995). See 515 U. S. 1129 (1995). In Allied-Bruce, we restated what our decisions in Southland and Perry had established:      \"States may regulate contracts, including arbitration clauses, under general contract law principles and they may invalidate an arbitration clause `upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.' 9 U. S. C. § 2 (emphasis added). What States may not do is decide that a contract is fair enough to enforce all its basic terms (price, service, credit), but not fair enough to enforce its arbitration clause. The Act makes any such state policy unlawful, for that kind of policy would place arbitration clauses on an unequal `footing,' directly contrary to the Act's language and Congress's intent.\" 513 U. S., at 281. On remand, without inviting or permitting further briefing or oral argument,    the Montana Supreme Court adhered to its original ruling. The court stated: \"After careful review, we can find nothing in the [Allied-Bruce] decision which relates to the issues presented to this Court in this case.\" Casarotto v. Lombardi, 274 Mont. 3, 7, 901 P. 2d 596, 598 (1995). Elaborating, the Montana court said it found \"no suggestion in [Allied-Bruce] that the principles from Volt on which we relied [to uphold § 27-5114(4)] have been modified in any way.\" Id., at 8, 901 P. 2d, at 598-599. We again granted certiorari, 516 U. S. 1036 (1996), and now reverse. Section 2 of the FAA provides that written arbitration agreements \"shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\" 9 U. S. C. § 2 (emphasis added). Repeating our observation in Perry, the text of § 2 declares that state law may be applied \"if that law arose to govern issues      concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally.\" 482 U. S., at 493, n. 9. Thus, generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening § 2. See Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 281; Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 483-484 (1989); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226 (1987). Courts may not, however, invalidate arbitration agreements under state laws applicable only to arbitration provisions. See Allied-Bruce, 513 U. S., at 281; Perry, 482 U. S., at 493, n. 9. By enacting § 2, we have several times said, Congress precluded States from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status, requiring instead that such provisions be placed \"upon the same footing as other contracts.\" Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 511 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted). Montana's § 27-5114(4) directly conflicts with § 2 of the FAA because the State's law conditions the enforceability of arbitration agreements on compliance with a special notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally. The FAA thus displaces the Montana statute with respect to arbitration agreements covered by the Act. See 2 I. Macneil, R. Speidel, T. Stipanowich, & G. Shell, Federal Arbitration Law § 19.1.1, pp. 19:4-19:5 (1995) (under Southland and Perry, \"state legislation requiring greater information or choice in the making of agreements to arbitrate than in other contracts is preempted\").         The Montana Supreme Court misread our Volt decision and therefore reached a conclusion in this case at odds with our rulings. Volt involved an arbitration agreement that incorporated state procedural rules, one of which, on the facts of that case, called for arbitration to be stayed pending the resolution of a related judicial proceeding. The state rule examined in Volt determined only the efficient order of proceedings; it did not affect the enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself. We held that applying the state rule would not \"undermine the goals and policies of the FAA,\" 489 U. S., at 478, because the very purpose of the Act was to \"ensur[e] that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms,\" id., at 479. Applying § 27-5114(4) here, in contrast, would not enforce the arbitration clause in the contract between DAI and Casarotto; instead, Montana's first-page notice requirement would invalidate the clause. The \"goals and policies\" of the FAA, this Court's precedent indicates, are antithetical to threshold limitations placed specifically and solely on arbitration provisions. Section 2 \"mandate[s] the enforcement of arbitration agreements,\" Southland, 465 U. S., at 10, \"save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,\" 9 U. S. C. § 2. Section 27-5114(4) of Montana's law places arbitration agreements in a class apart from \"any contract,\" and singularly limits their validity. The State's prescription is thus inconsonant with, and is therefore preempted by, the federal law. For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.",
