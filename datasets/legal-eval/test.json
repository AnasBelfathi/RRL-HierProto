The petitioner in Criminal Petition No.100829 of 2019 is arrayed as accused No.3 in C.C.No.832 of 2016 on the file of II Additional Civil Judge and JMFC, Chikodi for the offence punishable under Section 32 and 34 of the Karnataka Excise Act. 3. The petitioner in Criminal Petition No.100830 of 2019 is arrayed as accused No.5 in C.C.No.1448 of 2018 on the file of I Additional Civil Judge and JMFC Court, Chikodi for the offence punishable under Sections 32, 34, 36 and 38(A) of the Karnataka Excise. 4. In all the aforesaid criminal petitions the grounds of revision are similar. The petitioners have sought for quashing the entire criminal proceedings initiated against them on the following grounds : (a)The petitioners are falsely implicated and the charge sheet has been filed against the petitioners merely on the information said to have been disclosed by the other accused persons who have been apprehended while conducting the raid.\n (b)These petitioners have been accused of committing the alleged offences punishable under Sections 32 and 34 of the Karnataka Excise Act, but they were not caught/ arrested while selling the liquor at the spot. \n         (c) The allegations made in the complaint and FIR are vague and there are no sufficient grounds for proceeding against the petitioners. (d)The complainant/respondent has not at all followed the mandatory provisions under Section 154 of Cr.P.C. The initiation of criminal proceedings against the petitioners suffers from serious infirmities. \n         (e) In the event of continuation of proceedings they will be put to great hardship and injustice. 5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and learned HCGP-State. \n 6. The main grounds urged for quashing the further proceedings in C.C.Nos.1923 of 2017, 832 of 2016 and 1448 of 2018 against the petitioners are that, [I] The order passed by the learned Magistrate taking cognizance is not in accordance with law. \n (II) The procedure prescribed under Section 154 of Cr.P.C. is not followed, thus the entire proceedings stands vitiated. 7. In support of the said contentions, the learned counsel for the petitioners has cited the following decisions. (i) State of Haryana and Others Vs.\n               CH.Bhajan Lal and Others, AIR 1992 SC 604.\n (ii) Rajiv Thapar & Ors. Vs. Madan Lal Kapoor, AIR 2013 SC (Supp) 1056.\n (iii) K.Ramachandra reddy Vs. State of Karnataka by the Station House Officer & Another, (2013) 1 KCCR 334.\n (iv) Smt. Shashikala W/o. Annasaheb Jolle Vs. The State of Karnataka, Crl.P.\n No.101186/2018. \n (v) Shri.   Girishchandra  S/o.\n Veerbhadrayya Hiremath and another Vs. The State by Lokayukta, ILR 2013 KAR 983.\n (vi) Somashekhrappa S/o. Late Chowdappa Vs. The State of Karnataka by Lokayukta, 2013 STPL 10533 Karnataka. \n (vii) H.Ganga Setty and Others Vs. The State of Karnataka and another, Crl.P.No. 5802/2016. \n (viii) Vikas Kumar @ Vikas S/o Sukhalal Jain Vs. The State of Karnataka, Crl.P.No.4476/2018. (ix) State of M.P. Vs. Mukesh and Others, (2006) 13 SCC 197.\n (x) Sasi Vs. State of Kerala, (2000) 10 SCC 360.\n (xi) Ram Parkash Vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1959 SC 1. \n 8. Per Contra, the learned HCGP submitted that the defects pointed out by the learned counsel are not glaring or material defects. Thus, there are no valid grounds for quashing the proceedings. \n 9. It is well settled that, the power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. has to be exercised by the High Court, inter alia to prevent the abuse of process of any Court or otherwise secure the ends of justice. When the Criminal proceedings are initiated based on the illicit material collected on search and arrest which are per-se illegal and vitiated not only a conviction and sentence passed on such material but also the trial itself. The proceedings cannot be allowed to go on as it amounts to abuse of process of the Court. In such a case not quashing the proceedings would perpetuate the abuse of process of the Court resulting in great hardship and injustice to the accused. \n 10. In a decision reported in (2013) 1 KCCR 334 case of K.Ramachandra Reddy Vs. State of Karnataka by the Station House Officer & Another, it is observed as under : \"23. The position in law will have to be referred to at this juncture. This Court, in the case M/s. Vijaya Bank Vs. State by the Labour Enforcement Officer, reported in ILR 2000 Karnataka 4773, has held that taking cognizance of an offence being a judicial act after application of kind, the Magistrate should not use \"printed Proforma\" in which even the words \"Cognizance is taken, are also printed or typed.\" \n 11. Having regard to the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioners, this Court has gone through the entire charge sheet records and orders passed by the Magistrate for taking cognizance and others. In all three criminal cases, wherein the petitioners are arrayed as accused, the orders passed by the Magistrate for taking cognizance are in a printed proforma. In view of the decisions reported in ILR 2000 Kar. 4773 and (2013) 1 KCCR 334 taking cognizance of an offence being a judicial act after application of mind the Magistrate should not pass the order mechanically in a printed proforma. In present cases, it is evident that the orders of cognizance are in printed proforma as such they are not in accordance with law. 12. The next ground is that regarding the procedure to be followed under Section 154 of Cr.P.C. The main contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that the excise officials have conducted the raid without registering the FIR, hence the proceedings initiated against the petitioners cannot be sustained in law. \n 13. In a decision of division bench of this Court in Criminal Petition No.15941 of 2012 in the case of Sri.Girishchandra S/o. Veerabhadrayya Hiremath and another Vs. The State by Lokayuktha Police, Yadri, it is observed as under: \"10. With regard to the question whether registration of FIR should precede the investigation or that FIR could be registered under the midst of the process of investigation would always depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. In a situation where an offence is committed right in the presence of a police officer, it would be imprudent to insist that he should rush to the police station to record the FIR. The police officer should immediately act, like apprehending the accused, sending the victim to medical treatment etc., and thereafter registration of FIR would be an ideal investigation procedure. Otherwise, in all other type of cases, registration of FIR is mandatory since an FIR is to be sent to the Court at the earliest stage, so that no manipulating and tampering of facts would be possible. \n If the FIR is sent to the Court, all further investigation should necessary be consistent with the FIR.\" \n         14. In the instant cases, the excise officials have conducted the raid without registering the FIR on the basis of the credible information received by them. Thus, it is apparent on the face of the record that the procedure prescribed Under Section 154 of Cr.P.C. is not followed as such FIR is untenable. \n 15. In the context of facts of this case that the conduct of investigation by surprise raid in the absence of FIR is untenable and the same would be illegal. \n 16. For the aforesaid reasons, this Court is of the view that there are valid grounds for quashing the proceedings. Accordingly, I pass the following : ORDER Criminal Petition Nos.100827, 100829 and 100830 of 2019 are allowed. \n The proceedings in C.C.No.1923 of 2017 on the file of II Additional Civil Judge and JMFC, Chikodi for the offences punishable under Section 32 and 34 of the Karnataka Excise Act, 1965 and Section 188 of IPC initiated against the petitioner-accused No.2 (Crl.P.No.100827 of 2019) and in C.C.No.832 of 2016 on the file of II Additional Civil Judge and JMFC, Chikodi for the offence punishable under Section 32 and 34 of the Karnataka Excise Act initiated against the accused No.3 (Crl.P.No.100829 of 2019) and in C.C.No.1448 of 2018 on the file of I Additional Civil Judge and JMFC Court, Chikodi for the offence punishable under Sections 32, 34, 36 and 38(A) of the Karnataka Excise Act initiated against the petitioner-accused No.5 (Crl.P.\nNo.100830 of 2019) are quashed. \n Sd/- JUDGE CKK",

Ld. A.P.P, Rourkela Counsel for the defence..... Sri.R.K Singh Advocate Status of the accused :On bail\n\n          Offence U/S. 47 (a) B & O Exice Act\n                     J U D G M E N T \n 1. The accused stands charged for allegedly committing offence u/s 47(a) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act (hereinafter referred to as B & O Excise Act) . 2. The case of the prosecution as unfolded from the PR is that on 07.07.11 at about 12.10 PM while the then Inspector of Excise, Panposh charge, Sri.M.K.Sethi was performing patrolling duty along with his staff at Manko forest area, on suspicion he detained the accused persons, who were going in a LML City scooter bearing regd. no. OR-14-8000. After observing all legal formalities of search, he searched the accused persons and recovered one rubber tube containing some liquid substance, which on measurement was found to be 27 liters . The Inspector of Excise conducted blue litmus test and hydrometer test of the contents of the rubber tube. From such tests, from the color, odor and taste of the liquid and from his departmental experience and distillery training he confirmed the contents of the rubber tube to be nothing but ID liquor. Hence he seized the same from the possession of the accused persons along with the scooter and prepared seizure list. He drew sample for the purpose of chemical examination and destroyed the rest of seized articles on the spot due to inconvenience in transportation . \n On completion of inquiry he submitted PR against the accused persons for allegedly committing offence U/s 47(a) B & O Excise Act. Hence this case. 3. The plea of defence is one of denial and false implication . 4. Points for determination : (i)   Whether on 07.07.11 at about 12.10 PM , at Manko forest area the Excise officials seized 27 liters of ID liquor from exclusive and conscious possession of the accused persons ? \n (ii) Whether the seized article was nothing but ID liquor? 5. In order to substantiate its case prosecution has examined as many as three witnesses out of whom P.W.3, is theInspector of Excise, P.W.1and PW 2 are the Excise Constables who had accompanied PW 3 during the alleged patrolling .On the other hand the defence has preferred not to examine any witness on behalf of the accused persons .\n 6. In order to establish seizure, P.W.3 has deposed that on 07.07.11 at about 12.10 PM while he had been for patrolling duty with his staff at Manko forest area, on suspicion he detained the accused persons, who were going in a LML City scooter bearing regd. no. OR-14-8000 . He has stated that after observing all legal formalities of search, he searched the accused persons and recovered one rubber tube containing some liquid substance, which on measurement was found to be 27 liters . He has further stated that he tested the contents of the rubber tube by blue litmus paper and it turned into red and also conducted Hydrometer test. As per his evidence from such tests and from his departmental experience and distillery training as well as the color, odor and taste of the fluid, he confirmed the same to be nothing but ID liquor. Hence, he seized the same along with the scooter in presence of witnesses and prepared seizure list vide Ext.1. The evidence of PW 1 reveals that he drew sample for the purpose of chemical examination and destroyed the rest of seized articles on the spot due to inconvenience in transportation . PW 3 has further stated that he issued requisition to the RTO for ascertaining the ownership of the seized scooter vide Ext 4 and received the report of RTO to that respect vide Ext 6 . a perusal of Ext 6 reveals that the seized scooter belongs to one Phillip Xalxo, who is not the accused in this case . \n P.W 1 and PW 2 have deposed all most in the same light as that of P.W.3 but with some vital discrepancies . PW 2 has stated that they had been for patrolling duty to Tarkera area on the relevant date of occurrence . Similarly during the course of cross-examination on one hand P.W.3 has stated that as the spot was a jungle area he could not procure any local witness but to his utter contradiction PW 1 has stated in his cross examination that the spot was a densely populated area . Hence there is contradiction and inconsistency in the evidence of prosecution as regards the exact location and nature of the spot of alleged seizure . No spot map has also been adduced in evidence from the side of prosecution . In the absence of independent corroboration to the evidence of the Excise personnel, the prosecution case is suspicious. \nProsecution has also not adduced any evidence that the accused persons had dominion or control over the seized article. In view of the above discussion, the fact that the seized article was recovered from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused persons becomes doubtful. Hence, it is concluded that prosecution has failed to prove the factum of seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused persons beyond all the reasonable doubts. 7. So far as the nature of liquor is concerned though P.W.3 has deposed that he tested the contents of the rubber tube with the help of blue litmus paper and such paper turned into red and also conducted Hydrometer test . As per his evidence from such tests and from his departmental experience and distillery training as well as the color, odor and taste of the fluid, he confirmed the same to be nothing but ID liquor. He has further deposed that he drew and sent sample for the purpose of chemical examination. P.W.3 has identified the hydrometer chart as Ext.2, tested blue litmus paper as Ext.2/2, requisition for chemical examination report as Ext. 5 and his Expert declaration certificate as Ext 3 . In this case Ext. 3 reveals that P.W.3 has got enough expertise in identifying liquor so his opinion can be regarded and accepted as expert opinion as per Sec 45 of the Evidence Act . Even though PW 3 has stated that he had sent sample for chemical examination but no such CE report has been adduced in evidence .In this case where the accused is facing trial for illegal possession of ID liquor , when the prosecution has filed to establish that the contraband was seized from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused, the opinion of PW 3 is hardly of any assistance for prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused. 08. In the present case after analyzing the evidence on record, I find it fair enough to acquit the accused on the ground that prosecution has miserably failed to prove the occurrence itself. \n In the result I hold the accused persons not guilty of offence u/s 47(a) of Bihar and Orissa Excise Act and areacquitted therefrom as per the provision of section 248(1) of Cr.P.C. The accused persons be set at liberty forthwith and be discharged from their bail bonds so far as this case is concerned . 9. The seized liquor, if any , be destroyed and the seized vehicle be handed over to its rightful owner after four months of expiry of the appeal period in case of no appeal and in case of any appeal as per the order of the Appellate Court. Enter this case as mistake of fact for statistical purpose .

Patra\n                                       APP, Rourkela.\n\nCounsel for the defence : Sri. R. Prasad & Associates,\n                                       Advocates, Sundargarh.\n\n                                        J U D G M E N T\n1. The above named accused stands charged on the allegation of having committed offence U/s.47(a)(i) of the Bihar & Orissa Excise Act.\n 2. The prosecution case in brief is that:- On 09.09.2016, at about 08:30 A.M, when the Excise Officials were engaged in patrolling duty at Lungei village area on suspicion they detained one Kishor Khes and on search recovered one motor tube containing seven liters of ID Liquor, from which smell of liquor was coming out. Thereafter, the Excise official conducted blue litmus paper test and hydro meter test on the spot and brought the seized articles to the Excise Office. After completion of investigation, the P.R was submitted against the accused U/s.47(a)(i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act and he faced the trial. 3. The plea of accused is complete denial. 4. The points for determination for prosecution in this case are as follows:- i) Whether on 09.09.2016 at about 08:30 AM the above named accused person was found with seven litres of I.D. liquor without any valid license or authority?\n ii) Whether the said seized liquid were nothing but ID Liquor? \n 5. Out of the 3 witnesses as mentioned in the P.R, only two are examined. \n However, defence has examined none to repudiate the charge leveled against the accused person. 6. The testimony of P.W.1, the S.I of Excise reveals that on the relevant date i.e. 09.09.2016, at about 08:30 AM, when he was performing patrolling duty along with other Excise Staff at Lungei area, on suspicion conducted search on the accused namely Kishor Khes and recovered one motor tube containing seven litres of ID liquor. P.W.1 stated that he conducted blue litmus paper test and hydro meter test which confirmed the seized liquid to be nothing, but ID liquor and thereafter, he prepared the seizure list on the spot, which is marked as Exhibit-1 and his signature thereon is marked as Exhibit- 1/1. The Hydrometer chart is marked as Exhibit -2 and the signature of P.W.1 on that is marked as Exhibit- 2/1. In his cross-examination, he stated that the seized articles are not produced before the Court. He also deposed that he had not sent the seized article for chemical examination. S.I. again stated that he has not submitted any experience certificate. P.W.2 i.e. the constable of Excise narrated the same as stated by his officer. His signature on the seizure list is marked as Exhibit-1/2. His signature on hydrometer chart is marked as Exhibit-2/3. P.W.2 in his cross-examination deposed that he had no prior acquittance with the accused person and at para-3 he stated that the seized article are not produced before the Court. He also deposed that he can not say the name of independent witnesses. \n 7. Hence, from the close scrutiny of the above mentioned witnesses of the prosecution, it is found that none of the witnesses examined on behalf of prosecution has supported the prosecution story except the official witnesses. \nP.W.1, further stated that the seized articles were not produced before the Court for proper appreciation. Even, prosecution has not come up with proper explanation for non-production of the seized articles. Hence, the prosecution has not been able to prove the sine qua none i.e. \"exclusive & conscious possession\" of the offence punsihable U/s.47(a) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act. In a case reported in 93 (2002), CLT, 684, the Hon'ble High Court of Orissa has held that :- \"In a case of this nature where neither the liqor was seized or produced before the Court nor it was sent for chemical examination and no reason for non- production and no cogent explanation for non- production has been shown by the prosecution and when independent witnesses did not support the seizure, in such case, the evidence of the prosecution is not sufficient to convict the accused.......\"\n8. Regard being had to the facts of the case, evidence adduced by the witnesses and afore mentioned analysis, it can be irresistibly concluded that prosecution has not been able to prove the allegation against the accused beyond all reasonable doubts. Resultantly, the accused is held not guilty for the offence punishable U/s.47(a)(i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act and is hereby acquitted thereunder U/s.248(1) of Cr.P.C. He be set at liberty forthwith and his bail bond stands cancelled. Enter this case as mistake of fact for statistical purpose. \n J.M.F.C,(R), Rourkela The seized articles, if any, be destroyed after expiry of four months of appeal period in case of no appeal, if there is an appeal, the same shall be disposed of as per the order of the order of the appellate Court. \n J.M.F.C,(R), Rourkela The judgment is pronounced in the open court on this the i.e. 2nd day of July, 2018 and given under my hand and seal of this court. \n J.M.F.C,(R), Rourkela Dictated and corrected by me. \n J.M.F.C,(R), Rourkela List of witnesses examined by prosecution: P.W.1    Srutikanta Rout P.W.2    Ramesh Ch.

Then the S.I conducted blue litmus paper test which turned into red and also conducted hydrometer test, on the said liquor and seized the same under seizure list in presence of witnesses. Then the S.I seized the same under seizure list in presence of witnesses. After completion of inquary as prima facia well established against the accused the S.I submitted P.R against the accused U/s.\n 47 (a) B & O Excise Act. Hence, this case. \n 3.  The plea of defence is one of complete denial and false implication of the said charges. 4.  The points for determination in this case are:- 1. Whether on that alleged date, time and place the the SI of Excise seized 5 liters of I/D Liquor from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused? \n 2. Whether the seized liquid is nothing but I.D. Liquor ? 5. In order to establish the case the prosecution has examined all the two witnesses in total. Out of whom PW.1, is the S.I. Of Excise and P.W.2 is the constable. On the other hand, defence has examined no witness on his behalf. \n 6. P.W.1, the ASI of Excise has stated that, on 12.05.2011 While the S.I of Excise and other staffs were performing patrolling duty at Kardega. They saw a person moving with a carrying a jairkin. On suspicion, they detained the person. \n On search they recovered 5 liters of I/D liquor from possession of the accused. \n On being asked she could not produce any license or authority in support of such possession . Then the S.I conducted blue litmus paper test which turned into red and also conducted hydrometer test, on the said liquor and seized the same under seizure list in presence of witnesses. Then the S.I seized the same under seizure list in presence of witnesses. P.W.-2, being the constable who has attached to the S.I at the time of search and seizure has stated the same thing that of P.W.1. \n 7.  The learned defence counsel vehemently urged that when the seized liquor was not produced in the court, when PW-1 is not an expert to test the liquor, when there is no malakhan entry for the seized material when no batch of the seized articles was specified on the P.R, when no conscious possession of contraband liquor by the accused is proved, when the seized liquor was not sent for chemical examination. No seizure list was proved by the prosecution and the independent witness has been examined by the prosecution has not supported the prosecution to prove the seizure list. It is further argued that the only witness supported to the prosecution case is the official witness and to appreciate the evidence of official witness great care has to be given by the court. Hence it is found that prosecution has significantly failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt against the accused and as such the case is entitled for a clear acquittal. Controvert the submission of the defence counsel the learned APP submitted that none prosecution of the seized article in the court and none support of the independent witness is not fatal for prosecution. \nAccordingly he prays to convict of the accused. 8. It is settled in law that in such type of cases have to prove beyond all suspicion that is exclusive conscious possession and the liquid is nothing but ID liquor. For proving the first point that is conscious possession of the contraband article I had examined the evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.2 who had in their cross- examination by the defence had admitted that the S.I had seized the liquor from the accused on the way, but no seizure witness supported the said fact. Both the two witnesses being official one to believe their testimony great care is to be taken. But, no one has stated anything regarding the other persons present at the spot at the time of such seizure. So no way exclusive and conscious possession is proved by the prosecution. \n 9. For proving the second point that is the seized liquor was ID liquor and nothing other than it scrutinized the evidence of P.W.1 , the officials witness who has actually made search and seizure of the case. Though he has stated that he knew the liquid was liquor from the smell and his long experience and from the blue litmus and Hydrometer test. But, in support of his experience he can not produce any document nor the tested litmus is found on the seizure list. Another thing I found in this record that there is no mention of any batch no in the seizure list, no station diary had been seized by the Excise S.I. of the case and no malakhana entry was done in the malakhana registered relating to the seized article. The most important thing I found in this case is that the S.I who has actually seized the liquor has not been examined by the prosecution. He being the vital witness his non-examination surely affects the case of prosecution. 10. In the result, I hold the accused is not guilty for commission of offence U/s. 47 (a) B & O Excise Act and he is acquitted there from U/s.248 (1) Cr.P.C. He be set at liberty. His bail bond stands canceled. \n \"Enter the case as a mistake of fact.\"\n                                                                    J.M.F.C, ROURKELA Typed to my dictation, corrected by me and pronounced the judgment in the open Court to-day given under my hand and this the 24th day of August, 2015. \n J.M.F.C, ROURKELA List of witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution: P.W.1:   Sri Fakira Dehuri. \n P.W.2:   Sri Sharat Kumar Naik.

The petitioner is a dealer registered under the provisions of the Act and is engaged in the execution of works of contract of construction, supply, erection and commissioning of cooling towers for power plants, steel plants etc. Apart from this, the petitioner is also engaged in trading of spare parts of cooling towers. \n 3. The petitioner being aggrieved by the order of re-assessment dated 29.04.2016 for the tax periods in question, approached this Court in W.P.Nos.35155- 166/2016 inter alia contending that the order of re- assessment has been passed in gross violation of the principles of natural justice inasmuch as reply dated 29.04.2016 filed by the petitioner had not been considered before passing of the order of re-assessment. The Writ Court dismissed the said writ petitions observing that the petitioner has a equally adequate and efficacious alternate remedy under the Act of filing appeal before the Appellate Authority to challenge the correctness of the order of re-assessment dated 29.04.2016.\n 4. Being aggrieved, Writ Appeal Nos.1929- 1940/2016 were preferred by the petitioner. The Division Bench of this Court vide order dated 21.07.2016, disposed of the writ appeals as under: \"(i) The impugned order dated 29.4.2016 Annnexure  D as per the declaration made by the respondent shall stand cancelled.\n (ii) The matter shall stand restored to the file of the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes.\n (iii) The appellant-petitioner or their representative shall remain present on 6th August 2016 at 11.00 a.m. for the purpose of hearing.\n (iv) It would be open to the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes to pass a fresh order after considering the objections filed on behalf of the appellant dated 29.4.2016 and after hearing the representative of the appellant.\n (v) The order of the learned Single Judge is set aside. The appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent.\"\n 5. Pursuant to which the Assessing Authority  respondent No.1 has issued notice under Section 39[1] of the Act relating to the tax periods in question, proposing certain additions to tax liability which was objected to, by the assessee in terms of the reply dated 15.02.2018. Again, a revised notice dated 11.06.2018 was issued by the respondent No.1 to which a detailed reply/objections was filed by the assessee. Finally, the Assessing Authority  respondent No.1 has passed an order under Section 39[1] of the Act, which is impugned herein. \n 6. Learned Senior Counsel Sri.R.V.Prasad representing the learned counsel for the petitioner on record would submit that the scope of remand passed by the Division Bench of this Court in W.A.Nos.1929- 1940/2016 was limited. It was not an open remand to enable the first respondent to issue a fresh notice rescinding the earlier notice. The order of re-assessment impugned is wholly without jurisdiction and accordingly deserves to be quashed. Learned Senior Counsel submitted that the order impugned is barred by limitation in terms of Section 40 of the Act. Reliance is placed on the following judgments: [i] Jamsheed Hormunsji Wadia V/s. Board of Trustees, Port of Mumbai and Another; [2004] 3 SCC 214; and [ii] State of Kerala V/s. M.R.F. Limited , [2016] 90 VST 304 [Ker] .\n 7. Learned Additional Government Advocate justifying the order impugned would submit that fresh/additional documents were placed by the assessee-petitioner before the Assessing Authority pursuant to the directions issued by this Court in W.A.Nos.1929-1940/2016 which necessarily required further adjudication on such material. Hence, fresh notice under Section 39 [1] was issued and after providing an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner an order has been passed under Section 39[1] of the Act which is well within the period of limitation. 8. I have carefully considered the rival submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record. 9. It cannot be disputed that the directions issued by this Court in W.A.Nos.1929-1940/2016 lays down limit; it is certainly not an order of open remand. \n The Assessing Authority was competent to exercise the jurisdiction within the ambit of the order of remand. It is beneficial to refer to the judgment of the Hon'ble High Court of Kerala in the case of M.R.F Limited., supra, wherein it is held thus: \"8. It is settled principle that where the order of remand lays down limits for the enquiry to be made by the lower court, that court ought to confine to questions which fall within those limits . The exercise of jurisdiction by the lower court to which an order of remand is made depends on specifications of the order of remand. It is not open to any of the parties or to the court below to enlarge the scope of the remand order. To do otherwise would be destructive of all tenets of judicial discipline and will strike at the root of the efficacy and binding nature of an order of a superior court. Even when a matter is remitted to High Court by the Supreme Court, if the High Court assumes wider field of jurisdiction than one which has been permitted by the Supreme Court through the order of remand, and thereby enters into examining the whole controversy afresh and as if all contentions of all parties are open before it, such a view would not be countenanced. See: Jamshed Hormusji Wadia v. Board of Trustees, Port of Mumbai [AIR 2004 SC 1815]. The law laid through that precedent is authority for the proposition that when an order of remand is made by the superior court for the purpose of considering certain aspects, the court to which the case is remitted cannot assume a wider field of jurisdiction than the one which is permitted by the superior court through the remand order. The court below is bound by the order of remand and cannot examine the whole controversy afresh, as if all the contentions of all the parties were open before it. Such an approach by a court below would not be countenanced. That was a case where the Apex Court was dealing with the effect of an order of remand made by it to a High Court. \n        For further support, see Budhilal v.\n        Jagannathdas [AIR 1963 MP 344] rendered holding that when limits for enquiry are laid down by an order of remand, the court to which the case is remanded would have no jurisdiction to enter into questions falling outside those limits.\" \n 10. Similarly, it would be opt to refer to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Jamsheed Hormunsji Wadia supra, wherein it is observed thus: \"22. We have set out in the earlier part of this judgment, the order of remand dated 31.10.1995 made by this Court. A careful reading of the judgment of the High Court and the order of remand passed by this Court together significantly reveals that none has cast any reflection __ much less any adverse one __ on the report of Kirloskar Consultants and the decision of the Board based thereon. \n        The only consideration which prevailed with the High Court and this Court was one of reasonability and the need for striking a balance before taking a long leap in the direction of an upwards revision of rates. The stand throughout taken by the Board has to be appreciated. It has been agreeable to every reasonable suggestion made by the Court and has never treated the issue as to revision of rent as a matter of its prestige or with the ego of a landlord. This Court made a remand to the Division Bench of the High Court persuaded by the consideration that there were a few aspects of paramount significance which needed the attention of the Division Bench of the High Court. The fact remains that in the quest for an amicable, and if not so, then at least a reasonable resolution of the dispute, the Division Bench of the High Court as well as this Court have proceeded on an assumption that for the future, the settlement whether mutual or by dictum of the Court, shall centre around the Compromise Proposals. This Court wanted the Court to be assured for itself and the lessees to be satisfied for themselves that the Compromise Proposals were not just an arrow shot in the dark but were capable of being illuminated by assigning reasons. At the same time, though all the lessees were to be treated alike so far as laying down of common standards governing different classes of leases was concerned, care had also to be taken to redeem the grievances of certain individual lessees who could make out a case for further legitimate reduction in rates on account of peculiarities attaching with the land or lease held by them. Later, while delivering the 2000 judgment, which is impugned herein, the Division Bench certainly assumed a wider field of jurisdiction than the one which had been permitted by this Court and entered into examining the whole controversy afresh and as if all the contentions of all the parties were open before it, which view of the High Court, in our opinion, cannot be countenanced on a reading as a whole of the order of remand passed by this Court along with the judgment of the Division Bench which was impugned then.\" \n 11. In the light of these judgments, it is clear that when an order of remand is made by the Division Bench of this Court directing the petitioner-assessee to remain present before the Authority on 06.08.2016 at 11.00 a.m., and the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes  Assessing Authority to pass a fresh order after considering the objections filed on behalf of the assessee dated 29.04.2016 and hearing the representative of the assessee, the same cannot be enlarged to usurp jurisdiction than the one permitted under the remand order. It is not in dispute that the petitioner had appeared before the respondent- Authority on 06.08.2016 as directed by this Court. The Assessing Authority is bound by the order of the remand and ought to have acted accordingly. Issuing fresh notices and thereafter deciding the matter expanding the directions of the order of remand was not called for. \n 12. Hence, on this ground, the order of re- assessment passed under Section 39[1] of the Act dated 18.07.2018 at Annexure-H cannot be sustained and accordingly is quashed. The proceedings are remanded to the Assessing Authority  respondent No.1 to re-do the assessment strictly in terms of the directions issued by the Division Bench of this Court in W.A.Nos.1929- 1940/2016 dated 21.07.2016 in an expedite manner in any event not later than two weeks from the date of receipt of certified copy of the order. \n With the aforesaid observations and directions, writ petition stands disposed of. \n Sd/- JUDGE NC.\n ",

RESPONDENT\n\n(BY SMT.RASHMI JADHAV, HCGP) THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION\n482 OF CR.P.C. PRAYING TO QUASH THE ORDER DATED\n30.06.2020 PASSED BY THE ADDL. C.M.M., BENGALURU IN\nCR.NO.77/2019 IN TAKING COGNIZANCE OF THE OFFENCE\nAND PRAYING FOR QUASH THE PROCEEDINGS IN\nCR.NO.77/2019 PENDING BEFORE THE VII ADDL.C.M.M.,\nBENGALURU AND THE CHARGE SHEET FILED BY THE\n\nRESPONDENT FOR THE OFFENCE P/U/S 420 AND 511 OF IPC\nIN FIR NO.77/2019.\n\n         THIS CRIMINAL PETITION COMING ON FOR\nADMISSION, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING THROUGH\nVIDEO CONFERENCE:\n\n                                    O R D E R \n1. The petitioner is before this Court seeking for quashing of the order dated 30.06.2020 passed by the VII Additional A.C.M.M., Court, Bengaluru in Crime No.77/2019 taking cognizance of the offence and for quashing of the proceedings in Crime No.77/2019 registered for the offences punishable under Section 420 and 511 of Indian Penal Code. 2. The complaint had been filed on 24.03.2019 at 7.45 p.m., respondent No.1-police alleged that the petitioner was trying to sell fake stolen nagamani representing that it was an original nagamani and on receipt of information thereto, the complainant visited the spot and found the petitioner sitting in a Creta car carrying a bag with a gem and brass plate. 3. On enquiry as to the source of the said gem and brass plate, petitioner was unable to furnish any details. It is in this background the above complaint was filed contending that the said gem \"nagamani\"\n      was stolen. 4. On investigation, a charge sheet has been laid against the petitioner alleging that the petitioner was trying to sell the gem and cheat the probable purchaser. On receipt of charge sheet, the Magistrate has passed an order as hereunder: \"Perused the complaint. Charge sheet, statement of witnesses and other documents/records. There are sufficient materials to proceed against the accused person/s for the offence/s alleged. \n                           Hence, cognizance of the offences U/S 420, 511 of IPC against accused is taken U/s.190(1) (b) of Cr.P.C and office is directed to register the case as C.C.in register No.III.\n                           Issue SS to accused by 25.08.2020\"\n  5. Sri. Gangadharappa. A.V, the learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the entire complaint as filed, investigation carried out and the charge sheet filed is only a figment of imagination. Firstly, for the reason that there is no scientific evidence of existence of a nagamani. Hence, for the complaint to claim that there was a nagamani sought to be sold itself is a figment of imagination. Apart there from he submits that initially, complaint had been filed contending that the petitioner has stolen nagamani from somewhere and was trying to sell the same. \n      However, when the charge sheet was laid the said offence under Section 379 of IPC has been given up and what the petitioner has been charged for is as regard the offence punishable under Section 420 and 511 of IPC. \n 6. Sri Ganghadharappa.A.V, learned counsel for the petitioner, in this regard would submit that if Section 420 of IPC is to be attracted, there must be an offence committed under Section 415 of I.P.C., i.e., the offence ought to have occurred/committed prior to filing of the complaint. Even, if the entire allegation in the complaint as also the charge sheet is taken on face value, at best, it would amount preparation for committing of an offence of cheating which is not recognized as punishable and as such he submits that charge sheet laid is not in accordance with law. Learned Magistrate without appreciating these facts in a laconic manner has taken cognizance and issued summons to the petitioner. 7. Per contra, Smt. Rashmi Jadhav, learned HCGP would submit that the fact that the petitioner was found with a bag containing a gem and he was trying to sell the same would suffice for the purpose of satisfying ingredient for 420 of IPC inasmuch as the petitioner was planning to sell the said gem as nagamani and if someone had bought it, they would suffer serious injury, it is in order to prevent such an occurrence, a complaint was filed and prosecution taken up against the petitioner. 8. Heard Sri.Gangadharappa.A.V, learned counsel for the petitioner and Smt. Rashmi Jadhav, learned HCGP appearing for respondent  State. 9. The point that would arise for consideration is whether a prosecution can be initiated against the accused for preparation to commit an offence of cheating or whether offence has to be committed for initiation of a complaint and prosecution thereof? \n      What order? 10. The Criminal law has been enacted to punish an offender that would essentially mean that offence has to be committed for an offender to be punished. \n      Though criminal law has also recognized deterrence i.e., to deter by way of possible imposition of punishment on the occurrence or the committal of an offence, the same does not contemplates imposition of punishment prior to committal of the offence, a person may plan to commit an offence but that does not result in actual commission of offence requiring such a person to be prosecuted and/or punished. \n 11. In the present facts, there is no complaint which has been filed, no one is alleging an act of cheating or they being cheated by anyone by the petitioner. The allegation against the petitioner is only that he had a gem in his bag which he proposed to sell to an unwary customer or otherwise for a large sum of money claiming that gem to be a nagamani. None has approached the jurisdictional police alleging that there is an offence like this committed. Hence, I am of the considered opinion that none of the ingredients that are required under Section 415 of IPC to attract punishment under Section 420 of IPC are satisfied. 12. Hence, proceedings in Crime No.77/2019 pending on the file of VII Additional A.C.M.M., Court, Bengaluru are quashed. \n      The petition is allowed. \n Sd/- JUDGE nms",

Petitioner\nS/o Shekar Poojari\nAged about 31 years\nR/at Yashoda Nilaya\nNear Petrol Bunk, Mudarangadi,\nUdupi Taluk, Udupi District-577 573.\n\n(By Sri B.Lethif, Advocate)\n\nAND :\n\nThe State of Karnataka\nby Kavooru Police Station, Bengaluru City \nRepresented by State Public Prosecutor \nHigh Court Building, Bengaluru-560 001. ... Respondent\n(By Sri Vijayakumar Majage, Addl. SPP)\n\n        This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 482 of\nCr.P.C praying to quash the entire proceedings against\nthe petitioner in C.C.No.6287/2018 (CR.No.172/2018) of\nKavooru Police Station, Mangaluru for the offences\npunishable under Sections 3, 4, and 5 of I.T.P Act\npending on the file of the JMFC III Court at Mangaluru\nwhich is produced at Annexure-A, for the reasons stated\ntherein.\n\n         This Criminal Petition coming on for Admission this\nday, the Court made the following:-\n\n                                    O R D E R\n         This petition is filed by accused No.2 under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. praying to quash the proceeding in CC.No.6287/2018 (Crime No.172/2018 of Kavooru Police Station, Mangaluru), pending on the file of JMFC III Court, Mangaluru, for the offences punishable under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 (`ITP' Act for short). 2. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner-accused No.2 and the learned Additional SPP for the respondent-State. \n 3. The factual matrix of the case of the prosecution is that on 12.7.2018, the complainant got information from CCB Unit Police alleging that prostitution was carried on in a house near Jalligudde. Immediately, the complainant informed the higher officer and at about 2.35 p.m. along with panch witnesses he went to the spot and he found some women and men were inside the house. In one room he also found a men and a woman who were seen nude and were in compromising position. After they were dressed they were enquired and in the presence of the panch witnesses, the proceedings were initiated and a panchanama was drawn. After coming back to the police Station, a case has been registered in Crime No.172/2018. \n 4. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner-accused No.2 that the complaint filed by the Investigating Officer is without any authority. Even without making any entry in diary, the complainant went to the spot and the seizure mahazar was drawn and thereafter he got registered the case. It is his further submission that the said act of the complainant is contrary to the principle laid down in the case of Lalita Kumari Vs. State of U.P., reported in (2014) 2 SCC 1. It is his further submission that the raid has been conducted in violation of the provisions of Section 15 of the ITP Act. As per Section 15(2) of the ITP Act, the police Officer before making a search should be in the presence of two or more respectable inhabitants and at least one of whom shall be a woman of the locality in which the place to be searched is situate. But in the case on hand, the two panch witnesses are men and no reasons have been assigned as to why one woman has not been called as a witness. Under such circumstances, it amounts to nothing but violation of mandate of law. It is his further submission that the Investigating Officer himself has filed the complaint, investigated the case and filed the charge sheet, in violation of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Jasbir Singh @ Javri @ Jabbar Singh Vs. State of Haryana, reported in (2015)5 SCC 762. It is his further submission that there are so many contradictions in the complaint and other material. The registration of the case, investigation conducted by the same person and filing of the charge sheet is nothing but it is abuse of process of law. On these grounds, he prayed to allow the petition by quashing the proceedings. \n 5. Per contra, the learned Additional SPP has vehemently argued and submitted that though the complainant is the Investigating Officer in the present case, there are no allegations made as against the Investigating Officer about the personal interest which would prejudice the case of the accused. Under such circumstances, the principle laid down in Jasbir Singh's Case (cited supra) is not applicable to the present case. \nIt is his further submission that one WPSI and one WPC have also accompanied the Investigating Officer and in their presence raid was made and hence if that aspect is taken into consideration, there is no violation of Section 15(2) of the ITP Act. It is his further submission that the petitioner-accused No.2 is a habitual offender and there are no good grounds made out by the petitioner to quash the proceedings. On these grounds, he prayed to dismiss the petition. \n 6. I have carefully and cautiously gone through the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. \n 7. It is not in dispute that the information was received from CCB Police Unit and the complainant along with panch witnesses and his staff went to the place of incident, made a raid, drawn the mahazar and seized some of the articles. Though during the course of arguments, the learned Additional SPP submitted that as there were no other witnesses present including a woman and under such circumstances, the Investigating Officer has secured two witnesses and has drawn the mahazar, the complaint and other material clearly go to show that on receipt of information the Investigating Officer has secured the witnesses and thereafter along with his staff went to the place and made a raid. Not even a word has been whispered either in the panchanama or in the statement of the panch witnesses that the Investigating Officer has made all the efforts to comply with the provisions of Section 15(2) of the ITP Act. Under such circumstances, the contention taken up by the learned Additional SPP is not acceptable. \n 8. Even as could be seen from the records, it would indicate that the complainant himself is the Investigating Officer who has fully investigated the case and filed the charge sheet. It is well settled proposition of law that when the complainant is the Investigating Officer, definitely it is going to prejudice the case of the accused. \nUnder such facts and circumstances and as held in Jasbir Singh's Case (cited supra), it is going to the root of the case of the accused. Though it is contended by the learned Additional SPP that two women were present and during the course of investigation no such witnesses come forward to be witnesses, in that light no women witness signed the mahazar. But on perusal of the record no material is placed to substantiate the said contention. On going through the aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court, the main purpose for which the complainant himself cannot be the Investigating Officer is that if he himself investigates, there would not be any fair and proper investigation. In order to avoid the said aspect and not to prejudice the case of the accused, the said ratio has been laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court. In that light, the submission of the learned Additional SPP is also not acceptable. \n 9. Even as could be seen from the records, no material is produced to show that any entries were made in the station house diary immediately after receipt of the information and registration of the case. Under the said facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the considered opinion that the registration of the case and investigation conducted by the Investigating Officer is nothing but abuse of process of law. In that light, the petitioner-accused No.2 has made out a case so as to quash the proceedings. Accordingly, the following order is made:- Petition is allowed. The proceedings initiated as against the petitioner-accused No.2 CC.No.6287/2018 (Crime No.172/2018 of Kavooru Police Station, Mangaluru), pending on the file of JMFC III Court, Mangaluru for the offences punishable under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, stand quashed. \n Consequently, I.A.No.1/2019 is disposed of, as it does not survive for consideration. \n Sd/- JUDGE *ck/-",

It is submitted by Sri K.M.Shiralli, learned Counsel appearing for the appellant in Crl.A.No.2871/2011 that in this case there is an inordinate delay in sending the seized articles to the chemical examination by FSL in Bangalore. While the incident has happened on 30.12.2007, the samples were sent on 1.2.2008 and office of PW.16 receives the same on 2.2.2008 after a lapse of more than one month. It is his submission that nowhere it is mentioned that while sending the articles on 1.2.2008, the articles were found in the same position as they were seized on the date of seizure namely., 30.12.2007. No documents are kept to show that the articles were kept intact so far as the entrustment of the articles seized is concerned. It is his submission that PW.11 says that the articles were given to him by PW.1, whereas PW.14 says that the articles seized were given by him to PW.11. PW.11 nowhere in his evidence states that while receiving the articles the said articles were found in a sealed condition. It is his submission that the sample seal put by the raiding party at the place where the materials were sealed has not been forwarded to the FSL nor the office of PW.16 has noted in Ex.P20 that there was any seal in the articles received by them leave alone mentioning that the seal found tallies with the sample seal. It is his submission that the prosecution has not at all produced the said sample seal before the Court. Whereas the one which is produced as per Ex.P26-sample seal is originated from the office of FSL through PW.16. It is further submitted by him that the evidence of PW.16 is to the effect that the samples sent to his office were weighing between 26 grams and 27 grams each. \nWhereas PW.1 categorically states that taking an electronic weighing machine, 20 grams of the articles found in the possession of the accused was seized as samples. It is his submission that the prosecution has not explained as to how the weight differed in such an exorbitant manner and therefore it is certain that the articles which were given to PW.15 for examination were not the articles seized by the police. It is his further submission that seizure mahazar indicates that 520 tablets of Ketamine were seized and sent to the chemical examinor. Whereas PW.16 says that he has received only 425 tablets, which shows glaring discrepancy between the property seized and the property produced for chemical examination. It is further submitted by Sri K.M.Shiralli, learned Counsel appearing for the appellant that PW.16 has not stated the percentage of Narcotic drug in the property sent to him. Therefore, the real quantity of narcotic substance in the property sent by the prosecuting officer is not forthcoming. It is further submitted that there is a discrepancy regarding the colour of the substance seized by the raiding party as mentioned in the seizure mahazar and the colour of the substance mentioned by PW.16 while examining the articles sent for examination. Under the circumstances, there being such glaring discrepancy in respect of the material involved in the case, the only way would be to dis-believe the version of the prosecution witnesses so far as the identity of the property is concerned and to acquit them. \n 14. He has relied on the following rulings:- (i) 1993(2) CRIMES 267 (VALSALA v. STATE OF KERALA), where the Hon'ble Supreme Court has said that the delay of more than three months in sending the seized article to the Magistrate and article seized not kept in proper custody and proper form indicates perfunctory investigation and hence, the evidence adduced is insufficient to conclude that what was seized from the appellant alone was sent to the Chemical Examiner and convictions recorded not unsustainable; (ii) 1996 Crl.L.J. 3125 (MOHAMADALI SULEMAN VARACHHIA AND OTHERS v. THE STATE OF GUJARAT AND OTHERS), wherein, it is stated that when the sealed articles found to have changed when it reached to chemical analyst, inference as to its tampering in Police Station could be drawn. Since there is no evidence of genuineness of the articles given and hence, the accused is entitled for the benefit of doubt; and (iii) 2005 Crl.L.J. 1746 (STATE OF RAJASTHAN v.\nGURMAIL SINGH), it is held that Malkhana (Property) Register was not produced in evidence to prove that the seized articles were kept in the Malkhana, no evidence to prove satisfactorily that seals found were in fact same seals as were put on sample bottles immediately after seizure of contraband, acquittal of the accused was sound and proper. \n 15. Sri G.M.Bhat, learned Counsel appearing for accused No.2 also adopts the arguments of Sri K.M.Shiralli, learned Counsel appearing for accused No.1. \n 16. Sri V.M.Banakar, learned Addl.SPP appearing for the Respondent/State in both the appeals submits that the prosecution has placed reliable and convincing evidence to prove the case against the appellants. It is submitted by him that the evidence of PW.1 coupled with the evidence of PW.16 clearly establishes that the property seized from the possession of the accused is a Narcotic Drug and there is absolutely no discrepancy insofar as the identity of the property is concerned. PW.11 has categorically stated that he has received the property seized by PW.1 and thereafter he has sealed in the presence of PW.1 and handed over to PW.12 to be taken to the FSL. He further submits that PW.16 has stated that apart from Smt.Bhargavi, he himself has also examined the contents and thereafter an acknowledgement has been given as per Ex.P20. Both PW.16 and PW.12 have stated before the Court that the seals were intact and the said seals were tallied. So far as the Malkhana extract is concerned, when the same was marked before the Court as Ex.P18, both the accused never raised their objection either for marking or for admissibility of the said document and it is only in the arguments that they have raised the said issue. \nMere delay of one month caused in sending the articles to FSL has not diminished its character or value in the face of the certificate issued by PW.16 holding that the contents of the articles was a Narcotic drug. Therefore, there is absolutely no flaw in the case of the prosecution and the learned Special Judge has rightly convicted the accused persons. Hence, he submits that the appeal may be dismissed. \n 17. I have gone through the entire materials on record. It is seen that the discrepancies in the prosecution case so far as the identity of the original material seized in the case and the material which is tested by the chemical examiner is of serious effect in this case. While at the first instance the seizure has been effected on 30.12.2007, there is no convincing evidence as to whether exactly the same property was kept till 2.2.2008, the day on which the material was sent to the FSL, Bangalore. Evidence in this connection is not convincing because PW.1 who is the leader of the raiding party states that he has entrusted the said property to PW.11, whereas, PW.11 is a Constable. Section 55 of the NDPS Act states that `An officer-in-charge of a police station shall take charge of and keep in safe custody, pending the orders of the Magistrate, all articles seized under this Act within the local area of that police station and which may be delivered to him,....' Section 2(o) of the Cr.P.C., states that, police constable cannot become a Station House Officer and therefore a responsible officer-PW.1, who is an Inspector of Police at the first instance could not have entrusted the seized material in the hands of PW.11, who was only a police constable. The evidence of PW.11 is to the effect that the said article has been entered into the property register, which is marked as Ex.P18.\n 18. On a perusal of Ex.P18, it is seen that it does not contain the page numbers serially nor does it contain the signature of any superior officer of the Department. This aspect has been spoken by PW.11 himself in his evidence before the Court. Therefore, it is the case of the accused that Ex.P18 is not an authenticated register, which complies with the provisions of Section 55 of NDPS Act, insofar as entrustment of Narcotic Drugs to a responsible officer is concerned. Further, it is in the evidence of PW.16 that all the articles sent for examination were weighing somewhere between 26 grams and 27 grams. Whereas PW.1, states that after weighing in an electronic machine he has taken samples of 20 grams each and sealed them. Therefore, there is absolutely no explanation as to how the weight of the seized articles has increased by about 6 to 7 grams during the intervening period and therefore necessarily a doubt is created as to whether the articles sent for chemical examination were the same which were seized by the trapping party. Further, Ex.P20 is an acknowledgement by the FSL, Bangalore for having received the samples. It is elicited that one Smt.Bhargavi, has received the said articles in the office of PW.16. However, the said Smt.Bhargavi has not been examined before the Court. On a careful scrutiny of Ex.P20, nowhere it contains the mention that the articles were sealed or that the seal found on them has been compared with the sample seal sent by the prosecuting officers. Therefore, it is difficult to believe that the articles sent by PW.1 through PW.11 are the same as was seized at the time of raid. It is further very difficult to understand as to how the prosecution has not produced the sample seal, which was used for sealing the materials at the time of raid. Ex.P26 is the sample seal of the FSL with signature of PW.16, whereas, the sample seal of PW.1 or the raiding party for having sealed the materials has not at all been produced by the prosecution. \n 19. In that view of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that there is absolutely no link to the property which is alleged to have been found in the possession of the accused and the property which is subjected to chemical examination by PW.16. The discrepancy in this case is shockingly notable because it is a common man's knowledge that the materials diminish in their weight as the days pass by and there is no scientific reason why the weight should increase that also by about 25 to 30% from the date of preparing the samples till the date of their examination by the chemical examiner. \nUnder the circumstances, the submission made by the learned Counsel for the appellants that the samples sent to the chemical examiner is not the property, which is seized from the possession of the accused gains importance. The manner in which seized articles are entrusted to a constable and preserved as per a Malkhana-ex.P18 which is not authenticated, also adds to the perfunctory manner in which investigation is conducted and the seized articles are preserved. \n 20. This being a criminal case and the law applicable is a stringent one, when two views are possible, the view that is favourable to the accused has to be given effect to. If this principle is kept in mind having regard to the discrepancy in respect of the identity of the property, accused definitely are entitled for benefit of doubt and accordingly they are entitled for an order of acquittal holding that the prosecution has not proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. \n 21. Accordingly, both these appeals are allowed. The order of conviction and sentence passed against the appellants is set aside and they are acquitted of the offences levelled against them. It is submitted that the appellants are in custody, they are directed to be set at liberty forthwith, if they are not required in any other case. Fine, if any, paid, shall be refunded to them. \n Office is directed to transmit the operative portion of this Judgment to the Central Jail Authorities, Hindalaga. \n Sd/- JUDGE Vmb/cp*",

AND SEC. 669D) OF\nTHEI NFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT.\n\n         THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:- ORDER The petitioner apprehending his arrest in Crime No.135/2013 on the file of the respondent/police registered for the offences under Sections 419, 420, 465, 468 r/w. 34 of IPC and under Section 66 (D) of I.T. Act, 2000, is before this Court seeking for grant of anticipatory bail. 2. The respondent/police on the complaint of one Rajan Pillai M., have registered the above case against one Raghavendra Rao, Bhaskar Rao and have taken up investigation. \n 3. It is alleged that Manipal University, which is a deemed University, had invited applications for filling up the seats from the eligible candidates to MBBS course. The complainant on learning about the same contacted one Mr.Bhaskar Rao to secure a seat to his son for MBBS course. In response to the same, the said Bhaskar Rao assured the complainant that he would secure a seat to his son and he should pay a sum of Rs.12,50,000/- for getting the seat in the university. Thereafter, the complainant came down to Manipal from Kerala. At Manipal he contacted Bhaskar Rao, who in turn took him to A.1  Raghavendra Rao. As per the direction of the accused namely, Bhaskar Rao and Raghavendra Rao, the complainant gave cash of Rs.7,00,000/- and a cheque of Rs.5,50,000/- to the said accused for getting the seat to his son. Thereafter, Bhaskar Rao informed the complainant who had returned to Kerala that his son has been given a seat in MBBS course. Thereafter, as agreed the admission card was sent to the complainant's address at Kerala. In response to the same, the complainant along with his son came to Manipal university for taking admission. On producing the admission card which had been sent to them at the University they came to know that it is a fake admission card and his son has not been allotted any seat in MBBS course in the said university. The complainant thereafter on coming to know that he has been cheated in the case by the said accused namely, Raghavendra Rao and Bhaskar Rao filed his complaint before the respondent/police. On the basis of the same, the said police registered the case and took up investigation. The said police during the course of investigation arrested one Nithin Kumar and Soma Prabhu on 3.8.2013. On their interrogation, it is alleged they revealed the person claiming to be Bhaskar Rao who had got himself introduced to the complainant is none other than this petitioner, as the petitioner has changed his name as Bhaskar Rao. Thereafter, the Investigating Agency took steps to freeze the account of this petitioner maintained in Axis Bank, Bangalore Branch. The petitioner came to know that the police have got freezed his account due to his involvement in connection with this case when he verified from the bank as to how his bank account came to be freezed.  Therefore, apprehending his arrest at the hands of the respondent/police in the above case, he is before this Court seeking for grant of anticipatory bail. \n 4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits, the petitioner has no nexus with any of the accused namely, Raghavendra Rao or Bhaskar Rao. \nHe has not identified himself as Bhaskar Rao to the complainant in the case. He has not received any money alleged to have been paid by the complainant for securing MBBS seat to his son in Manipal University. The petitioner is a partner in a Partnership Firm known as RVM Enterprises situated at Bangalore, dealing in wholesale of commodities and hiring of vehicles. He has no nexus with the alleged transaction that has taken place in this case. He hails from a respectable family having deep roots in the society. Hence he be granted the relief as sought for by him. \n 5. Learned High Court Government Pleader on taking instructions from the Investigating Officer submits, this petitioner is also known as Bhaskar Rao. The other accused Raghavendra Rao is also known as Mohan. These two persons having changed their names as Raghavendra Rao and Bhaskar Rao have cheated the complainant assuring that they would get a seat to his son in MBBS course by taking an amount of Rs.12,50,000/- from them. The police have collected material to show that this petitioner and Mohan are Bhaskar Rao and Raghavendra Rao in the case. Material now collected by the Investigating Agency reveals that this petitioner is indulged in the case. Having regard to the modus operandi adopted, the offences alleged against him, in the circumstances, he is not entitled to the relief of anticipatory bail. \n 6. At the out set as the material on record reveals that the police are knocking at the doors of the petitioner to involve him in the case goes to show that apprehension of the petitioner that he is likely to be arrested in the case is well founded. \nTherefore, the petition that is filed by him seeking for anticipatory bail is maintainable. The petitioner is tried to be legged in the case on the basis of the information furnished by the two accused who have been arrested in the case namely Nithin Kumar and Somu Prabhu. According to the said accused, this petitioner is also called as Bhaskar Rao. Therefore, the police are after him. Having regard to the fact that the police are knocking at the doors of the petitioner to arrest him in this case and taking into consideration that their names have figured on the information furnished by the two arrested accused namely, Nithin Kumar and Somu Prabhu and further taking into consideration that the said two accused who have been arrested have already been released on bail by the Jurisdictional Magistrate, in the circumstances, I do not find any justification to decline the request of this petitioner. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER Petition is allowed.\n  The petitioner in the event of his arrest in Crime No.135/2013 on the file of the respondent/police, the said police are directed to release him on bail on his executing a personal bond in a sum of Rs.1 lakh with two sureties for the likesum to the satisfaction of the respondent/police subject to the following conditions:- 1. The petitioner shall appear before the respondent/police on or before 30.12.2013 for the purposes of his arrest and release. \n 2. He shall not tamper with the prosecution witnesses. \n 3. He shall make himself available to the Investigating Agency as and when required for the purposes of investigation.\n 4. He shall mark his attendance before the respondent/police on every 1st and 3rd Sunday on every month between 11 a.m.\n               and 3 p.m. till the investigation is completed. \n Sd/- JUDGE SA",

Ld. A.P.P, Rourkela Counsel for the defence..... Sri.P.K Mishra Advocate Status of the accused :In Custody\n\n          Offence U/S. 47 (a) B & O Excise Act\n                      J U D G M E N T \n 1. The accused stands charged for allegedly committing offence u/s 47(a) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act (hereinafter referred to as B & O Excise Act) . 2. The case of the prosecution as unfolded from the PR is that on 23.12.05 at about 07.25 PM while the then SI of Excise, EI & EB, Unit Sambalpur, Sri.\nS.K.Naik was performing patrolling duty along with his staff at Traffic gate market area, on receipt of reliable information he conducted raid in the hotel of the accused. After observing all legal formalities of search, he searched the hotel of the accused and recovered one rubber tube containing some liquid substance which on measurement was found to be 15 liters . The SI of Excise tested the contents of the rubber tube by blue litmus paper and it turned into red. He also conducted hydrometer test of the same. From such tests, from the color and odor of the liquid and from his departmental experience and distillery training, he confirmed the same to be nothing but ID liquor. Hence, he seized the same in presence of witnesses and prepared seizure list. On the basis of the P.R. submitted by the I.O. ,cognizance was taken and subsequently trial commenced against the accused for allegedly committing offence under section 47(a) of Bihar and Orissa Excise Act. Hence, this case. 3. The plea of defence is one of denial and false implication . 4. Points for determination : (i) Whether on 23.12.05 at about 07.25 PM , at Traffic gate market area the Excise officials seized 15 liters of ID liquor from exclusive and conscious possession of the accused ?\n(ii) Whether the seized articles was nothing but ID liquor ? \n5. In order to substantiate its case prosecution has examined as many as two witnesses out of whom P.W.2 is the SI of Excise and P.W.1 is the Excise staff who had accompanied P.W.2 during the alleged patrolling duty . On the other hand the defence has preferred not to examine any witness on behalf of the accused . \n6. In order to establish seizure, P.W.2 has deposed that on 23.12.05 at about 07.25 PM while he was conducting patrolling duty along with his staff at Traffic gate market area , on receipt of reliable information he conducted raid in the hotel of the accused. After observing all legal formalities of search, he searched the hotel of the accused and recovered one rubber tube containing some liquid substance which on measurement was found to be 15 liters . As per his evidence he conducted blue litmus paper test and hydrometer test of the liquid and after being confirmed about the nature of the liquid to be ID liquor, he seized the same from the possession of the accused and prepared seizure list vide Ext.1. P.W.1 has also deposed in the same light as that of P.W.2. \n        During course of cross-examination P.W.2 has admitted that the seized liquor has not been produced in court during course of trial. P.W.2 has further admitted that the spot was a busy place many people had gathered on the spot and he was not able to say the name of the witnesses present at the spot. He has further admitted that he had not verified any documents of ownership of the said hotel and that there were many consumers in the said hotel. It appears from the evidence adduced that though the spot of seizure was a house but no independent corroboration is there to prove the fact of seizure. In the absence of independent corroboration to the evidence of the Excise personnel, the prosecution case is suspicious. The seized article was also not produced before the Court during the course of trial. Prosecution has also not adduced any evidence that the accused had dominion or control over the seized article. In view of the above discussion, the fact that the seized article was recovered from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused becomes doubtful. \nHence, it is concluded that prosecution has failed to prove the factum of seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused beyond all the reasonable doubts. 7. So far as the nature of seized article is concerned P.W.2 has stated that he conducted blue litmus and hydrometer test of the liquid and from such test as well as from his Departmental experience and distillery training and the colour and odor of the liquid he confirmed the same to be nothing but ID liquor. Law is well settled that chemical test is the surest test of I.D liquor. \nWhere chemical test has not been done and other tests like blue litmus paper and hydrometer test etc has been done,the burden lies on the prosecution to establish that the officer is specially trained and has long departmental experience so that his evidence can be accepted as expert opinion and can substitute chemical test. In absence of any chemical test so also any document to prove that the S.I can be regarded as expert, it is not safe to rely on the testimony of P.W 2. In view of the above discussion, the allegation that the seized article is nothing but I.D liquor comes under cloud. Hence, it can be safely concluded that prosecution has failed to prove that the seized article is I.D liquor beyond all reasonable doubts. \n 08. In the present case after analyzing the evidence on record, I find it fair enough to acquit the accused on the ground that prosecution has miserably failed to prove the occurrence itself. \n In the result I hold the accused not guilty of offence u/s 47(a) of Bihar and Orissa Excise Act and is acquitted therefrom as per the provision of section 248(1) of Cr.P.C. The accused be set at liberty forthwith. 9. The seized articles be destroyed after four months of expiry of the appeal period in case of no appeal and in case of any appeal as per the order of the Appellate Court.\n  Enter this case as mistake of fact for statistical purpose .

Sessions Judge,\n             Mysore.\n\n              Crl. Mis.No.713/2013 \n\n             Khizar Ahmed, S/o Fayaz Ahmed,\n             Aged about 27 years, r/at No.1568,\n             1st Cross, 1st Stage, Rajivnagara,\n             Mysore City. \n\nRespondent:  [By Sri. S.P.Thyagaraju, Advocate]\n\n                               Vs.\n\n             The Station House Officer, Mahila\n             Police Station, Represented by Public\n             Prosecutor, Mysore District, Mysore.\n\n             O R D E R \n This is a bail petition filed by the Petitioner under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. to enlarge him on Anticipatory Bail. 2. The facts in nutshell as per the Petitioner are that, the Respondent Police have registered case against him in Cr.No.56/2013 for the offence punishable under Section 498(A) of I.P.C. and under Section 3 of D.P. Act.\n 3. The Petitioner has sought to release him on Anticipatory Bail on the ground that, he is innocent of the offences alleged against him and he has not committed any offence. In fact Petitioner himself had filed complaint against the parents of the Complainant in Cr.No.194/2012 for the offence punishable under Sections 324, 323, 504, 341, 506 r/w Section 34 of I.PC. on 13.12.2012 and Police registered the case and subsequently Udyagiri Police issued endorsement. The Petitioner has not at all involved in the case and Complainant has filed false complaint in order to harass the Petitioner. The Petitioner is a businessman and he is permanent resident of Mysore City. The Petitioner is the only earning member in his family and he has to look after his aged parents. The Petitioner is ready to furnish solvent surety to the satisfaction of the Court and he is ready to abide by all the conditions to be imposed by the Court. On these grounds, the Petitioner has sought to release him on Anticipatory Bail. 4. On behalf of the Prosecution the learned Public Prosecutor has filed objection to the bail Petition stating that, there are sufficient materials against the Petitioner for the offences alleged against him. The averments of the complaint are reiterated in the objection. The Petitioner has been absconding from the date of commission of the offence. If the Petitioner is released at this stage, he may abscond and he may tamper the prosecution witnesses. On these grounds, the Prosecution has sought to reject the bail petition. 5. Now, the points that arise for consideration of the Court are: 1. Whether the Petitioner has made out sufficient grounds to release him on Anticipatory Bail?\n 2. What Order? 6. Heard the arguments advanced by the learned advocate for the Petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor. \n 7. My findings on the above points are as follows: Point No.1 : In the Positive Point No.2    : As per final order for the following: R E A S O N S 8. Point No.1: The Petitioner is none other than the husband of the Complainant. The Complainant-Reshma Tahseen has lodged the complaint alleging that her marriage with Petitioner had taken place about 03 years back and her parents had given the dowry demanded by the Petitioner and thereafter the Petitioner was looking after her well for some days and thereafter he was harassing her physically and mentally and he was also harassing her alleging that she has not given birth to a male child. It is also alleged that she had lodged complaint before Women Police on one occasion and at that time, the Petitioner had assured that he would look after the Complainant well and NCR NO.16/2013 was issued. It is further alleged that the Petitioner used to assault, abuse and harass the Complainant. 9. The Petitioner has produced certified copy of the F.I.R.\nand Complaint in Cr.No.194/2012 which reveals that the present Petitioner had lodged complaint against the parents of the Complainant alleging that they had assaulted him on 13.12.2012 at about 11.30 p.m. Admittedly, the offences alleged against the Petitioner are not punishable with death or life imprisonment and they are punishable up to 05 years imprisonment and they are triable by J.M.F.C. Court. The Petitioner is said to be the permanent resident of Rajivnagar, Mysore and he is said to be the only earning member in his family and he has to look after his aged parents. Considering all these aspects, the Court is of the view that, the grievances of the Prosecution can be met by imposing some reasonable conditions. Hence, the above Point No.1 is held in the Positive. \n 10. Point No.2: For the foregoing reasons and in view of my above discussions, I proceed to pass the following: O R D E R The Bail Petition filed by Petitioner under Sec.438 of Cr.P.C. is hereby allowed.\n The Petitioner shall be released on Anticipatory Bail in the event of his arrest by the Respondent Police in Cr.No.56/2013 on his executing personal bond for Rs.25,000/- with one solvent surety for the like sum with the following conditions: 1.

The Petitioner shall apply for regular bail before the concerned Court within 30 days from today. \n [Dictated to the Stenographer, transcribed by her, corrected and then pronounced by me in open court, on this the 23rd day of May 2013]. \n [LAKSHMAN F MALAVALLI] V Addl.

PETITIONER\n\n(By Shri. B.M.Siddappa, Advocate)\n\nAND:\n\nThe State of Karnataka by\nChitradurga Town Police Station,\nRepresented by State Public Prosecutor. ...RESPONDENT\n\n(By Shri. B. Visweswaraiah, Government Pleader)\n                                   *****\n\n        This Criminal Revision Petition is filed under Section\n397(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, by the\n\nadvocate for the petitioner praying to set aside the order passed\nby the Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court,\nChitradurga in Crl.A.No.42/2007 dated 10.11.2009 and the\njudgment passed in C.C.No.216/2007 dated 24.07.2007 by the\nPrincipal Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) and Judicial Magistrate First\nClass, Chitradurga. \n\n       This Criminal Revision Petition having been heard and\nreserved on 12.11.2014 and coming on for pronouncement of\nOrders this day, the Court delivered the following:-\n\n                               O R D E R\n  The facts of the case are as follows: It was alleged that on 22.1.2007 at about 8.30 p.m., when the complainant, Vasantha, was proceeding to her house along I Cross, VP Extension, Chitradurga, on foot, the accused is said to have come from behind her and snatched her mangalasutra chain and is said to have fled with it. The complainant is said to have suffered an injury on her neck as a result of the same. A complaint is said to have been lodged on the next day, on the basis of which a case is said to have been registered against an unknown person. 2. It transpires that the accused was arrested by chance, by a police constable attached to the jurisdictional police, when he, PW-5 and another noticed the suspicious movements of the accused and arrested him and on further enquiry, the accused is said to have produced the chain from his possession at his house. The arrest was said to have been made on 23.1.2007 according to the said witness. Whereas the actual date of arrest was 25.1.2007, as stated by PW-6, the police inspector before whom the accused is said to have been produced. \n In any event after investigation after the accused was apprehended, a charge sheet was laid against him for an offence punishable under Section 394 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (Hereinafter referred to as the `IPC' for brevity). \n The accused having pleaded not guilty, the prosecution had examined 7 witnesses and marked several documents and a material object in support of its case. After recording the statement of the accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, (Hereinafter referred to as the `Cr.PC' for brevity) the trial court had held that the commission of the offence was proved and accordingly convicted the accused and sentenced the accused to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/-. \n The accused having preferred an appeal against the said judgment, the appellate court has dismissed the appeal and affirmed the sentence. It is that which is challenged in the present revision petition. 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that the courts below have failed to appreciate the glaring circumstances such as the identity of the accused having been established as the person who had committed the offence as well as other discrepancies. It is pointed out that the complainant who was examined as PW-1 had stated in her evidence that when the chain was snatched from her neck, the same had snapped, but it was found to be in tact when it was produced in evidence. It was also elicited in her evidence, that she had no chance to see the face of the accused, except to see him flee. And further that she had never seen the accused before, except in the court hall. It is pointed out that both the courts below have glossed over the above admissions in the evidence of PW-1. Admittedly, there was also no test identification parade to enable the complainant to identify the accused. The delay in lodging the complaint is not explained with any convincing reason. The fact that the complainant was a graduate but lacked the confidence to immediately lodge a complaint and had waited for her husband to assist her, is also sought to be highlighted. The admitted circumstance that there was a contradiction of the date on which the accused was said to have been arrested, with PW-5, the police constable who is said to have effected the arrest claiming that the accused was arrested on 23.1.2007 and the police inspector before whom he is said to have been produced claiming that he was arrested on 25.1.2007, the actual date of arrest, would indicate that the accused may have been falsely implicated. This is especially so when the manner in which the accused is said to have been arrested by chance and on the basis of alleged voluntary statements the article having been recovered from his possession is also not wholly convincing. \n 4. The learned Government Pleader, on the other hand, seeks to justify the conviction of the accused. 5. From the material on record, it is evident that the incident had occurred late in the evening and the accused is said to have snatched the chain from the neck of the complainant from behind and had fled. The complainant apparently had not been able to notice the facial features of the accused. Even the physical appearance if had been noticed, the same was not confirmed at a test identification parade, as admittedly none was conducted. The chances of the complainant having accurately identified the accused as being the person who committed the offence is therefore not established beyond doubt. \n The other incriminating evidence that is sought to be placed against the accused is the arrest made on suspicion, and by chance and the alleged voluntary statements of the accused leading to recovery of the said article. The very circumstances stated are not convincing. It is not even a case of the accused being a habitual offender and hence having been arrested having confessed to the robbery. The said circumstance also does not evoke the confidence of this court. Hence the findings of both the courts below cannot be sustained in the face of the flimsy evidence on record. \n Accordingly, the petition is allowed and the judgments of both the courts below are set aside and the accused is acquitted. \nThe bail bond stands cancelled. \n Sd/- JUDGE KS*",

(By Shri.Satish R.Giriji, HCGP)\n                                          *****\n\n          This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 438 of the\ncode of Criminal Procedure, 1973, praying to enlarge the\npetitioner on bail in the event of his arrest in\nC.C.NO.2143/2005 under Section 409, 477A, 414 of Indian\nPenal Code and etc. \n\n         This petition coming on for orders this day, the court\nmade the following:\n\n                                  O R D E R\n         Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government Pleader. 2. The petitioner is before this court seeking anticipatory bail, apprehending his arrest by the respondent  Police, for offences punishable under Sections 409, 477A, 414 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (Hereinafter referred to as the `IPC', for brevity). In a case in CC No.2143/2005, pending before the Egmore II ACMM Court, Chennai (Tamil Nadu) a non-bailable warrant was issued against the petitioner and other accused, who are said to be public servants. \nIt is the petitioner's case that he is not a public servant and therefore, the question of offences having been committed by the petitioner under the above provisions, is remote and he would be put to great hardship, as he has undergone a open heart surgery in the recent past, to be put through the proceedings of arrest and his production before the appropriate court and therefore, seeks anticipatory bail in order to enable him to overcome the situation. \n 3. The learned Government Pleader, on the other hand, would raise a serious objection that admittedly, the petitioner is sought to be arrested in a pending case before a court in Tamil Nadu and since this court would have no jurisdiction over that court or the investigating authorities, it would be improper to consider the petitioner's case for anticipatory bail. Hence, without anything more, the learned Government Pleader would submit that the petition be rejected, leaving the petitioner to his remedies before some other forum. \n 4. However, the learned Counsel for the petitioner would place reliance on a decision of this court in the case of L.R.Naidu vs. State of Karnataka, 1984 Cri.LJ 475, where in a similar situation, this court, relying on the decisions in B.R.Sinha vs. State, 1982 Cri.LJ 61; Pritam Singh vs. State of Punjab, 1981 Cr.LJ NOC 59 and Gurubaksh Singh vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1980 SC 1632,  has pointed out that it would not be impermissible for a court of one State to grant anticipatory bail, if the petitioner resides within its jurisdiction, in respect of apprehended arrest in a case pending in some other State, without the jurisdiction of the court and seeks to place reliance on the same. \n It is to be seen that the Supreme Court, while dealing with a prayer for anticipatory bail, in Gurubaksh Singh, supra, has held as follows:- \"In regard to anticipatory bail, if the proposed accusation appears to stem not from motives of furthering the ends of justice but from some ulterior motive, the object being to injure and humiliate the applicant by having him arrested, a direction for the release of the applicant on bail in the event of his arrest would generally be made. On the other hand, if it appears likely, considering the antecedents of the applicant, that taking advantage of the order of anticipatory bail he will flee from justice, such an order would not be made. But the converse of these propositions is not necessarily true. \nThat is to say, it cannot be laid down as an inexorable rule that anticipatory bail cannot be granted unless the proposed accusation appears to be actuated by mala fides; and, equally, that anticipatory bail must be granted if there is no fear that the applicant will abscond. There are several other considerations, too numerous to enumerate, the combined effect of which must weigh with the court while granting or rejecting anticipatory bail. \nThe nature and seriousness of the proposed charges, the context of the events likely to lead to the making of the charges, a reasonable possibility of the applicant's presence not being secured at the trial, reasonable apprehension that witnesses will be tampered with and \"the larger interests of the public or the State\" are some of the considerations which the court has to keep in mind while deciding an application for anticipatory bail.\"\n And the Calcutta High Court has held as follows in identical circumstances as arising in the case on hand:- \"Considering the provisions laid down in S. 438 of the Code and the principles of law with regard to anticipatory bail explained by their Lordship in Gurubaksh Singh's case (1982 Cr.

APP, RAJGANGPUR\nCounsel for the Defence: - Sri S. Panigrahi & Associates\n\nDate of Argument: - 09.02.2016 Date of Judgment:-15.02.2016\n\n                                 JUDGMENT\n  The above named accused persons stands prosecuted for the offence punishable u/s 498(A)/342/406/294/506/34 of Indian Penal Code. 2. The brief facts of the case is that the complainant Gressy Dungdung filed a complaint vide ICC No-18 of 2009 against the above named accused persons which was subsequently sent for investigation to Rajgangpur PS as per the provision of section 156(3) of Cr.PC and after completion of investigation police had submitted chargesheet in this case. The facts of the complaint petition is that the complainant Gressy Dungdung had married to accused Igness Bilung on dtd 22.01.2009. But after the marriage the accused Igness Bilung did not cohabit with the complainant and in due course of time she came to knew that the accused is impotent. When complainant disclosed this matter to her family members the accused persons out of anger subjected her to torture and demanded Rs20,000/- for treatment of accused no-1. \nWhen the accused no-1 was clinically examined he was found to be impotent and sexually incapable. As the torture of accused persons became unbearable the complainant returned to her parental home. In order to settle the dispute a Khadia Samaj meeting was convened but the decision for separation was arrived in that meeting. In that meeting it was also decided that the accused should returned all the articles to the complainant but the accused did not returned it. Being aggreived she went to PS to lodged the report on dtd 20.02.2009 and 28.03.2009 but as the police did not lodge FIR the complainant had filed the case. The case had been sent for investigation and after completion of it the police has submitted chargesheet u/s 498(A)/342/406/294/506/34 of IPC and section 4 DP Act.Hence this case.\n3. The plea of the accused persons were of complete denial and false implications as has been made in the statement recorded u/s 313 of Criminal Procedure Code. 4. The points for determination in this case are: i) Whether accused Igness Bilung being the husband of the complainant, Rosalia Bilung and other accused Juel Tete being the relative of the accused no.1 subjected the complainant to cruelty after her marriage in furtherance of their common intention? \nii) Whether accused persons in furtherance of their common intention wrongfully confined the complainant in the house so as to prevent her from proceeding beyond that limits? \niii) Whether accused persons in furtherance of their common intention abused the informant in obscene language in a public place so as to cause annoyance to her and others? \niv) Whether during the said period and place, the accused persons committed criminal intimidation by threatening the complainant to kill intending to cause alarm to her in furtherance of their common intention? \nv) Whether during said period and place, the accused persons being entrusted with the dowry articles of the informant, committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the same in furtherance of their common intention? \nvi) Whether during marriage, the accused persons demanded dowry directly or indirectly from the complainant? \n 5. To prove its case prosecution has examined eight witnesses out of whom PW6 is the complainant, PW5 is the MO, PW2 and PW3 are the seizure witnesses and the rest are the prosecution witnesses and marked Exhibits 1 to 2/1 on its behalf while the defence has neither examined any witnesses nor adduced any documentary evidence on its behalf to disprove the said allegation 6. P.W.6 is the complainant in this case deposed that she had married to accused Ignesh Bilung but after the marriage there was dispute between them hence she lodged the complaint. She further deposed that there was settlement between them in a village meeting and as per the settlement they are living separately. PW1 is the independent witness also supported the version of PW6 and deposed that there was decision of divorce between the complainant and the accused Ignesh Bilung in the meeting. PW7 and PW8 is the brother and sisiter-in-law of the informant also have not supported the prosecution case and narrated a similar version as P.W.6 by deposing that due to some matrimonial dispute, she has filed this case against the accused persons. But now, the matter has already been settled between them and the accused person and complainant are living separately. PW5 is the medical Officer deposed that there was a test of primary infertility of the complainant and not the accused . As regards the allegation against the accused persons complainant remained silent regarding the allegations made in Ext.2; rather deposed that now she does not want to proceed with the case since the dispute between them has already been settled. Hence, the above evidence adduced by prosecution suggest nothing to arrive at a conclusion that the accused persons have committed any of the offence as leveled against them. \n 7. In view of the discussions made above, and from the scrutiny of the evidences available on record, I am of the opinion that the culpability of the accused persons in the alleged offences is not proved by the prosecution beyond resonable doubt hence the above named accused persons are found not guilty for the offence U/S 498(A)/294/406/506/34 of IPC and section 4 DPn Act and they are acquitted therefrom u/s 248(1) of Cr.p.c.\n \"Enter this case as mistake of fact for statistical purpose.\"\n  The seized article if any be destroyed after expiry of appeal period if no appeal is preferred or as per the order of the appellate court if any appeal is preferred. \n JMFC, Rajgangpur. \n The judgment is pronounced in the open court today i.e on 15 th of February,2016 given under my signature and seal of this court.\n JMFC, Rajgangpur.\n List of witnesses on behalf of Prosecution PW.1  Sushil Lakra PW.2  James Kullu PW.3  Mary Puspa Kullu PW.4  Bernardette Kullu PW.5  Dr. Asha Kiran Kujur PW.6  Gressy Dungdung PW.7  Ella Dungdung PW.8         Ramesh Jaspal List of witnesses on behalf of Defence None List of exhibits marked on behalf of Prosecution Ext.1        Signature of PW.2 on SL Ext.1/1 Signature of PW.3 on SL Ext.1/2 Signature of PW.6 on Ext.1 Ext.2        Complainant petition attached with the FIR Ext.2/1 Signature of PW.6 on Ext.2 List of exhibits marked on behalf of Defence Nil List of MOs on behalf of Prosecution Nil List of MOs on behalf of Defence Nil JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE FIRST CLASS RAJGANGPUR",

The\nreward of that kindness was the murder of the lady of the\nhouse and her three year old son and causing serious injury\nto her five year old son. The appellant was, therefore,\ncharged and convicted under sections 302 and 307 of the\nPenal Code and sentenced under section 307 to imprisonment\nand to death under section 302. The High Court confirmed the\ndeath sentence and hence the appeal after obtaining special\nleave of the Court. Maintaining the conviction under sections 302 and 307\nI.P.C. and the sentence under the latter section, but\nmodifying the death sentence under section 302 to one of\nlife imprisonment, the Court\n^\n\n         HELD: 1. Altering the sentence of the appellant to\nimprisonment for life for the offence under section 302 of\nthe Penal Code, while maintaining the sentence under section\n307 Penal Code-the two sentences to run concurrently- will\nmeet the ends of justice, in the instant case, under the\nfollowing circumstances: [267A-B]\n\n         (a) He was just about 21 years of age on the date of\nthe offence and, very probably, a sudden impulse of sex or\ntheft made him momentarily insensible. (b) The evidence of\nSunil shows that immediately after the crime, he was found\nsitting in the chowk of the house crying bitterly.(c) Having\nachieved his purpose, he did not even try to run away, which\nhe could easily have done since his injuries were not of\nsuch a nature as to incapacitate him from fleeing from an\ninevitable arrest. (d) Though he was not insane at the time\n\nof the offence in the sense that he did not know the nature\nand consequences of what he was doing, still he was somewhat\nunhinged. He was kept in a mental hospital from July 19,\n1973 to February 2, 1975 where he had shown aggressive\nsymptoms and once even attacked another patient. (e) The\nbasic evidence in this case is of a child of five who\nanswered many vital questions with a nod of the head, one\nwayor the other. The extreme sentence cannot seek its main\nsupport from evidence of this kind which, even if true, is\nnot safe enough to act upon for putting out a life. (f) Non-\navailability of the useful data on the question of sentence\nwhich the trial court proposed to pass due to the trial\nJudge's failure to ask the appellant what he had to say on\nthe question of sentence and (g) the appellant has been in\njail for ten long years and probably would have earned by\nnow the right to be released, after taking into account the\nremissions admissible to him, were he sentenced to life\nimprisonment. [265 E-H, 266A, C-D, G]\n\n         2. The Trial Judge had a safe expedient in section\n235(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which he\nneedlessly denied to himself on technical consideration that\nby reason of section 484(2) (a) of the Code section 235 (2)\ndid not apply to trials which were pending on the date when\nthe new Code came into force. The Trial Judge ought to have\nquestioned the appellant on the sentence, whether the letter\nof section 235(2) governed the matter or not. That would\nhave furnished to the court useful data on the question of\nsentence which it proposed to pass. In any case, the trial\nwould not have been invalidated if the court were to apply\nthe provisions of section 235 which were introduced into the\nCode, ex debito justiciae. [266 D-F ]\n\n         3. A witness who, by reason of his immature\nunderstanding was not administered oath and who was\nprivileged, by reason of his years, not to make his answers\nin an intelligible and coherent manner is unsafe to be\n trusted whole sale . Children, in the first place, mix up\nwhat they see with what they like to imagine to have seen\nand besides, a little tutoring is inevitable in their case\nin order to lend coherence and consistency to their disputed\nthoughts which tend to stray. [266 A-B, C]\n\n          But, in the instant case, there are unimpeachable and\nthe most eloquent matters on the record which lend an\nunfailing assurance that Sunil is a witness of truth, not a\nwitness of imagination as most children of that age are.\n[263H,264A]\n\n         4. An assessment of the following corroborative\nevidence , in the instant case, clearly indicate that it was\nthe appellant who committed the murder of Geeta and her son\nAnil and caused injuries to Sunil: (a) the presence of the\nappellant proved by quite a large number of injuries during\nthe incident; (b) his conduct in not raising hue and cry at\nleast after the robbers had made good their escape, if any\nat the time of the killing of the mistress of the house, but\nlittle while later, he quietly walked to a neighbour and\ntrotted out the story that a few Badmashes intruded into the\nhouse and killed Geeta and her son; (c) the pattern of the\ncrime, that is, Anil was sleeping alongside his mother\nreceiving an injury and getting killed while the mother was\nassaulted and Sunil being assaulted in order that he should\nnot be left alive to identify the culprit, whom Sunil could\neasily identify as he was a household servant engaged mainly\nto look after the two boys: (d) the nature of injuries which\nwere found on the person of the appellant are typically of\n\nthe kind which a woman in distress would cause while\ndefending herself, and cannot be by a Badmash but would\notherwise deal with him if indeed the Badmash wanted to put\nthe appellant out of harm's way; (e) the weapons with which\nGeeta was defending herself at different stages of her life\nsaving fight with the appellant were snatched by the\nappellant and he hit her with those weapons, that is how\nsimilar injuries were found on the person of the deceased\nand the appellant by the same two weapons. [264 A-H, 265 B-\nC] \nJUDGMENT:\n         CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No.\n 281 of 1978. \n         Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated 4.11.77 of the Allahabad High Court at Allahabad in Criminal Appeal No. 1495 of 1977. \n L. N. Gupta for the Appellants. \n         H. R. Bhardwaj and R. K. Bhatt for the Respondent. \n         O. P. Rana for the Complainant. \n         The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, C. J. This is yet another case in which a young housewife has been done to death by a trusted servant of the family. Her three-year old son was murdered along with her and her five-year old son was seriously injured. \nThe incident occurred on May 6, 1971 at about 2.00 p.m. in House No. F-4/3, Kanoria Colony Quarters, Renukoot, where one Mohan Lal Khetan used to live with his wife Geeta and two sons Anil and Sunil aged three and five years respectively. Mohan Lal left for Allahabad for some work on the morning of the 6th. His wife and children took their food at about 1.00 p.m. and while they were resting, with a cooler on, they were assaulted as a result of which Geeta and Anil died and Sunil received serious injuries. The only other person who was then present in the house was the appellant, who was working as a household servant for a few years before the incident. His presence in the house at the material time is beyond the pale of controversy and indeed his very defence is that some intruders entered the house and caused injuries to Geeta, her two sons and to he himself. The appellant received quite some injuries in the incident which led to the death of Geeta and Anil. \n         Sunil, the five-year old son of Geeta, was examined by the prosecution as the sole eye witness in the case and his evidence has been accepted by the Sessions Court and the High Court. Shri L. N. Gupta, who has argued the case on behalf of the appellant with admirable precision and brevity, contends that no reliance should be placed on Sunil's evidence because he is a young child of immature understanding, that no oath was administered to him by reason of his lack of understanding of the sanctity of oath, that he did not implicate the appellant for two days or so at least and that hisstatement was recorded by the police about 20 days after the incident. Counsel further argues that in the very nature of things, it would be impossible for a young lad of 13 like the appellant to overpower, gag, assault and slay a well- built woman of 30 that Geeta was. The motive of the offence, according the Courts below, was to outrage the modesty of Geeta. It is urged that a boy of 13 could not possibly have entertained any such lewd thoughts. According to medical evidence, the injuries on the person of Geeta and the appellant were partly caused by a blunt weapon and partly by a sharp-edged weapon. That means that two different kinds of weapons were used against both of them and, what is more important, the same two weapons. According to counsel, that is more consistent with a stranger or strangers attacking Geeta and the appellant than with the appellant attacking Geeta. The appellant could not have attacked Geeta with two different weapons and even if Geeta were to retaliate, she could not have caused injuries to the appellant with the same two weapons. The final submission is that the prosecution case is rendered suspicious because the evidence of discovery of the iron rod, the knife, two gold bangles and the cash at the instance of the appellant has been disbelieved by the Sessions Court and the High Court. \n We have given our anxious consideration to these weighty considerations but on a close scrutiny of the evidence and the circumstances of the case we find ourselves unable to differ from the Courts below in regard to the assessment of the evidence in the case. Counsel is not right in saying that the appellant was only thirteen years of age in May 1971. It appears that the appellant gave his age as 13 during the committal proceedings but the age so given cannot be accepted as correct merely because, as counsel contends, the prosecution did not dispute the correctness of the assertion made by the appellant. There was no assertion in regard to the appellant's age and indeed it was not put in issue at any stage of the proceedings. The point regarding the appellant's age is being raised for the first time in this Court in the form and context in which it is raised by Shri Gupta. The reference to the \"tender age\" of the appellant was made in the Sessions Court on the question of sentence and not that of guilt, nor indeed in the context that the nature of the offence is such that the appellant could not have committed it, being just a boy of 13 or so. \nIt is not a matter of uncommon experience that the age of an accused is mentioned in the committal proceedings without proper inquiry or scrutiny since, in most cases, nothing turns on it. In fact if the appellantwas only 13 years of age at the time of the offence, the Sessions Court would not have failed to notice that fact and it would be amazing that the appellant's advocates in the Courts below should not advert to it, though the minutest contentions were raised in arguments and subtle suggestions were made to prosecution witnesses in their cross- examination. \n During the trial, the appellant was suspected to be of a deranged mind and was for that reason sent to the mental hospital at Varanasi. Exhibit K-20, which is the abstract of medical history maintained in that hospital , shows that at the time of the appellant's admission to the hospital on July 19, 1973 he was 23 years of age. The occurrence having taken place in May 1971, the appellant would be about 21 years of age at the relevant time. That is what the High Court has found while dealing with the question of sentence when it was urged before it that the death sentence should not be confirmed since the appellant was just 14 or 15 years of age on the date of offence. We concur in view of the High Court on the question of the appellant's age and agree with it that the age given by the appellant in the committal Court and the Sessions Court was a random statement not based on any reliable data. \n We cannot accept that an able-bodied boy of eighteen or nineteen could not have committed an assault of the present nature for the motive alleged. But we might mention that we are not in entire agreement with the Sessions Court and the High Court that the motive of the offender was necessarily to outrage the modesty of Geeta. It is not possible to record a positive finding that the motive necessarily was to commit theft or robbery, but the nature of injuries on the person of Geeta does not fully bear out the inference that the motive of the outrage was concerned with sex. There was no injury at all on Geeta's private parts or anywhere nearabout, not even a scratch or an abrasion. Most of the injuries were caused to her on the face and head. It seems to us more probable that Geeta woke up while the almirah was being ransacked and she paid the price of her courage. She resisted the robbery and was therefore done to death. \n Shri Gupta made a very plausible case against the acceptance of the evidence of Sunil, the child witness. We must confess that if the case were to rest solely on Sunil's uncorroborated testimony, we might have found it difficult to sustain the appellant's conviction. But there are unimpeachable and the most eloquent matters on therecord which lend an unfailing assurance that Sunil is a witness of truth, not a witness of imagination as most children of that age generally are. As we have stated earlier, the presence of the appellant is undisputed and is indeed indisputable. The appellant himself received quite a large number of injuries during the incident, which proves his presence in the house at the relevant time beyond the shadow of a doubt. If the appellant was present in the house at the time when Geeta was assaulted, it becomes necessary to examine his conduct without shifting the burden of proof on to him. If the mistress of the house was killed by robbers, we should have thought that the appellant would raise a hue and cry at least after the robbers had made good their escape. He did nothing of the kind and a little while later, he quitely walked to a neighbour and trotted out the story that a few \"Badmashes\" intruded into the house and killed Geeta and her son. Not only does the conduct of the appellant corroborate the evidence of Sunil, but the very pattern of the crime corroborates that it is the appellant who committed it. Anil was sleeping alongside his mother and he seems to have received an injury while the mother was assaulted. But Sunil was assaulted obviously in order that he should not be left alive to identify the culprit. The culprit whom Sunil could easily identify was the appellant who was a household servant engaged mainly to look after the two boys. Total strangers, whom even the appellant could not identify except as \"Badmashes\", would have no reason whatever to assault Sunil. \n The most important of the circumstances which corroborates the evidence of Sunil is the nature of injuries which were found on the person of the appellant. Those injuries are typically of the kind which a woman in distress would cause while defending herself. There is a trail of scratches and abrasions on the front portion of the appellant's body and it is not without significance, as contended by Shri Bhardwaj who appears on behalf of the State of U.P., that the injuries on Geeta are also all on the front portion of her body. A 'Badmash' would not deal with the appellant with his nails, if indeed he wanted to put the appellant out of harm's way. \n There is one more argument which requires to be dealt with, namely, that two different weapons and the same two weapons were used against both Geeta and the appellant. We are not quite sure whether Geeta had received an incised injury because, the injuries which were found on her forehead can give the appearanceof incised injuries, if caused by an iron rod. The skin just above a hard surface can break by a severe blow and give the appearance of an incised injury. But even assuming that the same two weapons were used on Geeta as also the appellant, it does not militate against the commission of the crime by the appellant himself. It is clear from the evidence of Dr.\nGuha and Dr. Sharma that all the injuries on the person of both Geeta and the appellant were on the front portions of their respective bodies. It is also clear that the injury which resulted in the death of Geeta as also her son Anil was caused by the iron rod. We are inclined to the view that the weapons with which Geeta was defending herself at different stages of her life-saving fight with the appellant were snatched by the appellant and he hit her with those weapons. That is how similar injuries were found on the person of both. \n We, therefore, agree with the Sessions Court and the High Court that it is the appellant who committed the murder of Geeta and her son Anil and caused injuries to Sunil. Crimes like the one before us cannot be looked upon with equanimity because they tend to destroy one's faith in all that is good in life. A starving youth was given shelter by a kindly couple. The reward of that kindness is the murder of the woman and her child. We cannot condemn adequately the utterly disgraceful and dastardly conduct of the appellant. But all the same, the question as to whether the death sentence is called for has to be examined in each case with dispassionate care. The appellant was just about 21 years of age on the date of the offence and, very probably, a sudden impulse of sex or theft made him momentarily insensible. The evidence of Sunil shows that immediately after the crime, the appellant was found sitting in the chowk of the house crying bitterly. Having achieved his purpose he did not even try to run away, which he could easily have done since, his injuries were not of such a nature as to incapacitate him from fleeing from an inevitable arrest. It would also appear that though he was not insane at the time of the offence in he sense that he did not know the nature and consequences of what he was doing, still he was somewhat unhinged. He was suspected to be insane during the trial and was kept in a mental hospital from July 19, 1973 to February 2, 1975. He was eventually declared fit to stand his trial but the evidence of Dr. R.\nN. Srivastava (P.W. 13), who was in charge of the hospital and the notes (Exhibit Ka-20) of the hospital show that the appellant hadshown aggressive symptoms and once, he had attacked another patient. Coupled with these considerations is the fact that the basic evidence in the case is of a child of five who answered many vital questions with a nod of the head, one way or the other. A witness who, by reason of his immature understanding, was not administered oath and who was privileged, by reason of his years, not to make his answers in an intelligible and coherent manner is unsafe to be trusted wholesale. We cannot also overlook, what Shri L. N.\nGupta highlighted, that Sunil's statement was recorded about 20 days later. There is valid reason for the delay, namely, his state of mind (he was a witness to the murder of his mother and an infant brother) and the state of his body (he was gagged as a result of which his clavicle was fractured).\n  Children, in the first place, mix up what they see with what they like to imagine to have seen and besides, a little tutoring is inevitable in their case in order to lend coherence and consistency to their disjointed thoughts which tend to stray. The extreme sentence cannot seek its main support from evidence of this kind which, even if true, is not safe enough to act upon for putting out a life. \n The learned Sessions Judge did not ask the appellant what he had to say on the question of sentence, holding that section 235 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 did not, by reason of its section 484 (2) (a), apply to trials which were pending on the date when the new Code came into force. We wish that the Sessions Court had questioned the appellant on the sentence, whether the letter of section 235(2) governed the matter or not. That would have furnished to the Court useful data on the question of sentence which it proposed to pass. In any case, the trial would not have been invalidated if the Court were to apply the provisions of that section which were introduced into the Code ex debito justiciae. The learned Judge had before him a safe expedient, the benefit of which he needlessly denied to himself on technical considerations. \n Finally, the appellant has been in jail for ten long years. He has probably earned by now the right to be released, after taking into account the remissions admissible to him, were he sentenced to life imprisonment. \n We suppose, though we are not confident, that some celebrity or the other must have visited the jail and large, wholesale remissions from sentence must have been doled out to the prisoners in order to commemorate the great and unusual event. \n In the result, we confirm the order of conviction but set aside the sentence of death imposed upon the appellant and sentence him to imprisonment for life for the offence under section 302 of the Penal Code. The sentence under section 307 will stand but the two sentences will run concurrently. \n S.R.                                  Appeal partly allowed.",

Rule made returnable forthwith. By consent, heard finally. 02.     Present application has been filed for quashing the first information report under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The first information report has been lodged by present respondent no.02, bearing Crime No. I176/2018, dated 08.05.2018, registered with Kotwali Police Station, District Ahmednagar, for offences punishable under Sections 324, 143, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code. \n 03.    The informant has contended that she resides with her husband and children. Her brother Dnyandev Nagare had come to her at about 07.30 p.m. on 07.05.2018 and told that her mother is ill and, therefore, she should come with him. Thereafter, they both were going from Kalyan Road from the left side of railway bridge. At that time, one Bandu Matkar, Arjun wagh (i.e. present applicant), Subhash Karale, Dilip Nagare, Macchindra Nagare, Digambar Karale and Dnyandev himself made her to stop and asked that she should settle the earlier dispute and she should take her children and come to her parent's house by leaving her husband. They all started abusing her in filthy language, assaulted her by kicks and fist blows. Thereafter, Bandu Matkar had assaulted her by means of piece of wire. She had got imprints of the wire and covert injuries. On the basis of these allegations, said FIR came to be lodged. \n 04.    The applicant has come with a case, that he is founder member and chairman of Kanifnath Bigar Sheti Sahkari Patsanstha Ltd., Jawkhede Khalsa. A civil dispute is pending between his family and respondent no.02's family in respect of agricultural land.  Initially, land bearing Gut No. 194/1 admeasuring 46 R, situated at village Wagholi, Taluka Shevgaon, District Ahmednagar, was owned and possessed by husband of the informant. The husband of the informant sold the said land in favour of one Bapusaheb Gawate and Sunil Virkar for consideration of Rs. 2,10,000/ on 17.05.2012. The reason was given that he wanted to purchase alternate land and to satisfy loan taken for agriculture. The said land Gut No. 194/1, admeasuring 46 R is adjacent to the land of the petitioner. Thereafter, Bapusaheb Gawate and Sunil Virkar had put the said land to sale on 29.10.2014 to the petitioner in the name of his son Tushar by way of registered sale deed for consideration of Rs. 2,60,000/. At the time of registration of the said sale deed, husband of respondent no.02 Narayan Matkar was present and has signed it as attesting witness. No objection was taken by him at the time of execution of the said sale deed. Respondent no.02 was, therefore, well aware about the sale of the said land. However, thereafter Regular Civil Suit No. 68 of 2015 was filed by son of the applicant against the family members of respondent no.02, for permanent injunction. Temporary injunction has been granted against respondent no.02  family members. \nThereafter, family members of respondent no.02 developed grudge against the petitioner and, therefore, he has been falsely implicated. \nRespondent no.02 had also filed a false and fabricated FIR on 20.05.2016 with Tophkhana Police Station at Ahmednagar for offences punishable under Sections 376, 354, 323, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code against the son of the applicant and others. The lodging of the FIR is nothing but harassment due to the previous enmity and, therefore, he has prayed for quashment of the same. \n 05.  The application is objected by respondent nos.01 and 02 .\n 06. Heard learned Advocate Mr. R.S. Kasar appearing for the applicant. Heard learned Additional Public Prosecutor Ms. V.S. Choudhari for respondent no.01. So also, heard learned Advocate Mr. D.A. Bide for respondent no.02. Learned Advocates appearing for the respective parties have argued in support of their respective contentions. \n 07.  Perused the police papers. \n 08.  Perusal of the FIR, in question, i.e Crime No. I176/2018 would clearly show that only statement is made that the present applicant was present and he had assaulted her by means of fist and kick blows.\n  It is to be noted that initially she says that her brother had taken her towards her mother's house. That means, she was not suspecting anything against brother but then she has also stated that her brother also assaulted her. She has not given as to what interest or motive the applicant had. She has not stated that any way, the applicant was related to her and what interest in separating her from her husband. \n On the contrary, the documents which have been produced on record by the applicant would show that the informant's husband had sold his land on 17.05.2012 to Bapusaheb Gawate and Sunil Virkar. \n Thereafter, these two persons have sold the property to applicant's son. One can find signature of the husband of the informant as attesting witness on the said sale deed. Further, in civil suit bearing R.C.S. No. 68 of 2015, injunction is granted against the defendants and the said suit is filed by son of the present applicant against husband of the informant. Thus, it can be seen that she had reason to implicate the applicant. The statements of the witnesses on record would show that none of them is an eye witness including husband of the informant. \n No doubt, as per the medical certificate, she had sustained, in all, nine injuries which were simple in nature. However, the object is stated to be hard and blunt object. Therefore, taking into consideration all these facts, case is made out for exercising inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as the case falls within the parameters laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Haryana & others Vs. Ch. Bhajan Lal & others [AIR 1992 SC 604]. \n 09.   Hence, the following order :  (a) The application is allowed. \n (b) The first information report bearing Crime No. I 176/2018, dated 08.05.2018, registered with Kotwali Police Station, District Ahmednagar, for offences punishable under Sections 324, 143, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code and consequential proceedings thereto, to the extent of the present applicant, are quashed and set aside. \n (c) Rule made absolute in the above terms. \n ( Smt.

JUSTICE SUNITA GUPTA\n                                       ORDER\n: SUNITA GUPTA, J. \n 1.       This application under Section 438 of Cr.P.C. has been filed by the petitioner/applicant seeking directions to release him on bail in the event of his arrest in the proceedings initiated by the Office of the Commissioner of Service Tax, IAEA House, 17-B, IP Estate, New Delhi under Section 14 of the Central Excise Act, 1944. \n 2.       The application has been filed by the applicant inter alia on the allegation that he is one of the directors of the company – M/s Sun Nirman Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. The company was incorporated in the year 2007. However, the applicant was not involved in its incorporation and was not connected with the said company in any manner whatsoever. The applicant purchased certain shareholding in the company and became one of the directors of the company since December, 2011/ January, 2012. It was only after January, 2012 that he stated looking into the affairs of the company. During his tenure, it was always the endeavour of the company to pay service tax on time. However, on account of earlier defaults and on account of business losses suffered by the company, there had been some delay in making payments towards service tax. The applicant received a notice dated 01.10.2013 from the Superintendent Service Tax (Anti-Evasion) from the office of respondent no.2 pursuant to which he appeared and submitted all the documents. His statement was duly recorded and it was informed that there are some alleged outstanding dues towards the service tax to the tune of Rs. 2.54 crores. Pursuant to another notice dated 26.11.2013, the applicant supplied most of the information including all the documents. In the month from March to June, 2013, the company paid a total sum of Rs.3 crores towards service tax dues to the department. Further, from September, 2013, approximately a sum of Rs.87 lac has been deposited. While the company was endeavouring to clear all the outstanding service tax dues, the respondent no.2 issue a notice to all the debtors of the company directing them not to make any payment to the company and instead deposit the same with the Service Tax Department. \nNot only that a notice was also issued to all the banks freezing the bank account of the company which resulted in virtual collapse of the business of the company. The officials of the respondent no.2 threatened the AR of the applicant that they would initiate action to arrest the applicant under the provisions of Central Excise Act, 1944 in case the entire outstanding dues are not cleared by the applicant as such apprehending arrest, the application in hand has been filed. 3.       It is submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant has all the intention to pay all the outstanding dues which is reflected from the fact that initially a payment of Rs.3 crores was deposited and thereafter a sum of Rs.87 lac was deposited. \nPursuant to the directions of this court, a sum of Rs.1 crore was deposited. Moreover, the applicant has resigned from the company with effect from 24.02.2014 and requisite Form No.32 was submitted before the Registrar of Companies and, therefore, the liability, if any, is of the company. In any case, the company has assets which are in excess of the amount liability which the respondent no.2 has claimed. Moreover, pursuant to the proceedings under Sections 397 and 398 read with Section 402 of the Companies Act, 1956, a retired Justice has been appointed as Chairman-cum-Director of the company. \nUnder the circumstances, it was submitted that protection be granted to the applicant. \n 4.       The application is vehemently opposed by learned counsel for the respondent no.2 by submitting that the application is neither maintainable in law nor on facts. An investigation against M/s Sun Nirman Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd registered with Service Tax for providing work contract service and construction service was initiated under Section 14 of the Central Excise Act, 1944. The applicant and the company remained non- cooperative during the investigation and also did not provide the requisite documents/details to ascertain the correct outstanding service tax liability. There is a prima facie case of non-payment of service tax amounting to Rs.2 crore which the applicant had already collected from the customers but did not deposit the same. Mr H.L.\n Sharma, director of the company and Mr Jatinder Proothi, head finance of the company in their statements under Section 14 of Central Excise Act stated that the applicant is the overall in-charge of the finance and responsible for not depositing the dues towards service tax. The applicant in his statement accepted the contents of the statements made by the aforesaid persons. The action to recover the government dues under Section 87 of the Finance Act, 1994 has been initiated against the company. It was further submitted that the applicant is not cooperating in the investigation. He did not appear in compliance to the summons on various dates. An affidavit of Mr R.R. Mittal, Superintendent was filed wherein it was submitted that in compliance of the court’s order, a sum of Rs.1 crore was deposited by the company. On 05.04.2014, they submitted part details and there was outstanding service liability of Rs.90,83,067/- for the year up to 2013 – 2014. \nAs on date i.e. 13.05.2014, the amount of service tax liability is Rs.1,01,53,662/-. \nAnother affidavit was filed by Mr R.R. Mittal, Superintendent stating therein that pursuant to the letter of the applicant regarding his resignation, the other director was summoned who informed that the applicant filed his resignation with Registrar of Companies without approval of Board of Directors. He is holding the designation of chairman-cum-director of the company and he is the only working director of the company and still holds all the records and documents of the company. All the directors are passing their responsibility on one and another and neither paying dues towards service tax nor providing requisite details to the department. In the subsequent affidavit filed by Mr Deepak Kumar, Superintendent stating therein that the applicant did not join investigation, pursuant to which a show cause notice has been issued. For the period up to 31.03.2014, a total amount of Rs.19,17,74,309/- along with cess and interest is due and out of which the company has paid a sum of Rs.5,04,83,070/-. 5.       It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondent no.2 that the applicant has committed crime against the country. He has collected taxes from the customers but not deposited the same with the government. This is glaring and striking instance of misappropriation of government money. Reference was made to number of authorities for submitting that economic offences are placed at higher pedestal than murder. \nMoreover, the application is pre-mature as even no order for arrest of the applicant has been passed by the competent authority. That being so, there is no apprehension of arrest of the applicant. It was further submitted that in view of law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Union of India and another v Ashwani Aggarwal [Crl. Appeal No.555/2000] and followed by this court even no notice for service of notice to the arrest of the applicant can be passed. As such, it was submitted that the application is liable to be dismissed. \n 6.       Needless to say, the allegations against the applicant are grave and serious in nature regarding misappropriation of government money. In Ram Narain Popli v CBI 2003 1 AD (Crl.) SC 253 it was observed as under: “The cause of the community deserves better treatment at the hands of the Court in the discharge of its judicial functions. The Community or the State is not a persona non grata whose cause may be treated with disdain. The entire community is aggrieved if economic offenders who ruin the economy of the State are not brought to book. A murder may be committed in the heat of moment upon passions being aroused. An economic offence is committed with cool calculation and deliberate design with an eye on personal profit regardless of the consequence to the Community. A disregard for the interest of the Community can be manifested only at the cost of forfeiting the trust and faith of the community in the system to administer justice in an even handed manner without fear of criticism from the quarters which view white collar crimes with a permissive eye, unmindful of the damage; done to the National Economy and National Interest, as was aptly stated in State of Gujarat v. Mohanlal Jitamalji Porwal and Anr., AIR (1987) 1321)”  Furthermore, a circular bearing number 974/08/2000-CX has been placed on record regarding the arrest and bail under Central Excise Act, 1944. As per this circular, the power to arrest a person needs to be exercised with utmost caution. Before arresting a person requisite permission from the competent authority is required. In the instant case so far no such permission has been granted by the competent authority. That being so, the applicant has no apprehension of arrest, as such, the application is premature. \n 8.       Moreover, no direction for issuing notice to the applicant in case of his arrest can be given in view of the observations of the Supreme Court in Union of India v Padam Narayan etc. [Crl. Appeal No.1575/2008] wherein it was observed and held as under: “Bail applications – anticipatory – respondents summoned under section 108 of the Customs Act – certain directions issued by the High Court to the Customs Authorities that in case the custom authorities find that any non-bailable offence has been committed by the respondents, they shall not be arrested without ten days prior notice - neither of the directions can be said to be legal, valid or in consonance with law. Firstly, the order passed by the High Court is a blanket one as held by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Gurbaksh Singh and seeks to grant protection to respondents in respect of any non-bailable offence. Secondly, it illegally obstructs, interferes and curtails the authority of Custom Officers from exercising statutory power of arrest a person said to have committed a non-bailable offence by imposing a condition of giving ten days prior notice, a condition not warranted by law. The order passed by the High Court to the extent of directions issued to the Custom Authorities is, therefore, liable to be set aside and is hereby set aside.”  9.       This view was reiterated in Union of India and another v Ashwani Aggarwal (supra) and followed by this Court in Department of Customs v Arvinder Singh [Crl.\nMisc. (M) No.1710/2002]. \n 10.      Under the circumstances, the application being premature is dismissed.\n  The interim protection granted to the applicant vide order dated 05.03.2014 stands vacated.\n  The application stands disposed of accordingly. \n (SUNITA GUPTA) JUDGE March 11, 2015/rd",

Nos. 806 and 807 of 1967).\n Civil Appeal No. 2518 of 1966 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami, J . In this case the respondent is a partnership firm carrying on the business of buying and selling cotton and also of ginning and pressing cotton at Bamala. The respondent purchased unginned cotton and after ginning the cotton by a mechanical process and removing the seeds sold the ginned cotton to customers outside, the State. For the period from 1st April, 1961 to 31st March, 1962 the respondent paid purchase tax on the purchase turnover. In respect of cotton seeds sold by it to registered dealers, the respondent claimed deduction from the purchase turnover under s. 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Punjab Sales Tax Act, 1948 (Act No. 46 of 1948). But, the assessing authority did not allow the deduction holding that the goods sold viz., cotton seeds were not the goods in respect of which purchase tax had been levied. In other words, the assessing authority took the stand that the uncotton underwent a manufacturing process and the goods produced were different from those purchased. So the respondent firm was assessed to pay a tax of Rs. 16,452 by the order of the assessing authority dated 11th September, 1963. The respondent firm thereafter filed a writ petition No. 1917 of 1963 in the Punjab High Court for quashing the assessment. The writ petition was allowed by the High Court which quashed the assessment and directed the assessing authority to redetermine the tax in the light of its judgment. In allowing the writ petition of the respondent the High Court followed its previous decision in Patel Cotton Company Private Ltd. v. State of Punjab & Ors.(1). The appellants preferred a Letters Patent Appeal which was dismissed. The present appeal is brought by, certificate from the judgment of the Punjab High Court dated 31st March, 1965. \nIt is necessary at this stage to set out the relevant provisions ,of the Punjab Sales Tax Act, 1948 (Act No. 46 of 1948) (hereinafter called the Act). Section 2(ff) omitting immaterial portions defines 'purchase' thus:- (1) 15 S.T.C. 865.\n851 \"Purchase, with all its grammatical cognate expressions means the acquisitions of goods specified in Schedule C............\"\n Schedule C Entry (1) and Entry (3) read thus \"(1) Cotton, that is to say, all kinds of cotton (indigenous or imported) in its unmanufactured state whether gined or unginned, baled, pressed or otherwise, but not including cotton waste\".\n \" (3) Oil seeds that is to say, seeds yielding nonvolatile oils used for human consumption or in or in the manufacture of varnishes, soaps and the like or in lubrication and volatile oils used chiefly in medicines, perfumes, cosmatics and the like\". \n Section 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act is to the following effect \"5 (2). In this, Act the expression \"taxable, turnover\" means that part of dealer's gross turnover during any period which remains after deducting therefrom (a) his turnover during that Period on (vi)the purchase of goods which are sold not later than six months after the close of, the year, to a Registered Dealer, or in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, or in the course of export out of the country\".\n Section 2(c) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (Act No. 74 of 1956) defines 'declared goods' to mean goods declared under section 14 to be of special importance in inter-State trade or commerce. Under section 14 of this Act certain goods were declared to be of special importance in inter- State trade or commerce and they included cotton, that is to say all kinds of cotton (indigenous or imported) in its unmanufactured state, whether ginned or unginned, baled, processed or otherwise, but not including cotton waste. \n Section 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 has been amended from time to time. Originally section 15 read as follows :- \"15, Restrictions and conditions in regard to tax on sales or Purchases of declared goods : Notwithstanding anything contained in the sales tax law of any State the tax payable by any dealer, under that law in respect of any sales or purchases of declared goods made by him inside the State shall not exceed two per cent of the sale price thereof, and such tax shall not be levied at more than one stage in a State\". \n (1) Sup. C.I.169-5 852 This section was amended by the Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act      (No. 16 of 1957) and again by Central Act No. 31 of 1958 and the amended section reads as follows :- \"15. Restrictions and conditions in regard to tax on sale or purchase of declared goods within a State : Every sales tax law of a State shall, in so far as it imposes or authorises the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of declared goods, be subject to the following restrictions and conditions, namely : (a)the tax payable under that law in respect of any, sale or purchase of such goods inside the State, shall not exceed two per cent of the sale or purchase price there of, andsuch tax shall not be levied at more than one stage; (b)where a tax has been levied under that law in respect of the sale or purchase inside the, State of any declared goods and such goods are sold in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, the tax so levied shall be refunded to such person in such manner and subject to such conditions as may be provided in any law in force in that State\". \nOn behalf of the appellants the argument was stressed that ginning process was a manufacturing process, and ginned cotton and cotton seeds were different commercial commodities and the respondent was not entitled to the exemption under s. 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act. It was said that unginned cotton was transformed into two distinct commercial commodities and there was no substantial identity between unginned cotton and ginned cotton or cotton seeds.\n It was argued that the ginning process required complicated machinery of manufacture. Reference was made in this connection to the mechanical aspect of the ginning process described in Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol. 6:-- \"Hand separation of lint and seed was replaced rapidly use of saw-type gins in the United States after the inventions of Eli Whitney in 1794 and of Hokden Holmesin 1796.\n                          Whitney's gin was improved upon by Holmes.who substituted toothed saws for the hooked cylinder and flat metal ribs for the slotted bar used by Whitney. The saws, metal ribs and doffing brush in these early models persist in modem gins, with no basic change in ginning principle having be-en made, although some modem gins substitute an air blast for the doffing brushes. \n                         853 Additional gin machinery has been developed to keep pace with changes in harvesting practices which have resulted in a trend from careful hand picking to, rougher hand and machine harvesting. These developments include seed- cotton driers, seed-cotton cleaners, burr extractors, greenboll traps and magnetic devices for removing metal. Line cleaners, designed to remove trash from lint after it had been removed from the seed, were added to modem gins in the late 1940s and 1950s. \n                         Improvement in grade, which resulted in a higher price for the lint, was, in some cases, offset by the loss in weight. Gin installations include presses for baling the lint and equipment for moving the seed away from the gin stands. While some of the seed is saved for planting purposes, most of it moves directly to an oil mill for processing\"(1). \nIn our opinion, the appellants are right in their contention that the ginning process is a manufacturing process. But the question presented for determination in the present case is somewhat different viz., whether the respondent is entitled to the exemption under s. 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act in the context and setting of the language of sections 14 and 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. \"Declared goods\"\nin section 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 are individually specified under separate items. \"Cotton ginned or unginned\" is treated as a single commodity under one item of declared goods. It is evident that cotton ginned or un- ginned being treated as a single commodity and as a single species of declared goods cannot be subject under s.- 15 (a) of the Central Sales Tax Act to a tax exceeding two per cent of the sale or purchase price thereof or at more than one stage. But so far as cotton seeds are concerned, it is difficult to accept the contention that the sale of cotton seeds must be treated as a sale of declared goods for the purpose of s. 15 (a) or (b) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. It is true that cotton in its unginned state contains cotton seeds. But it is by a manufacturing process that the cotton and the seed are separated and it is not correct to say that the seeds so separated is cotton itself or part of the cotton. They are two distinct commercial goods though before the manufacturing process the seeds might have been a part of the cotton itself. There is hence no wan-ant for the contention that cotton seed is not different from cotton. It follows that the respondent is not entitled to deduct the sale price of the cotton seeds from the purchase turnover under s. 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act. In our opinion, the assessing authority was right in holding that the respondent was not entitled to deduction in respect of cotton seeds sold by it to registered dealers. It is conceded that the assessing authority had (1) Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol. 6, page 614.\n 854 already granted deduction under s. 5 (2) (a) (vi) so far as ginned cotton is concerned. For these reasons we hold that the judgment of the Punjab High Court dated 31st March, 1965 in Letters Patent Appeal No. 100 of 1965 should be set aside and the writ petition No. 1917 of 1963 filed by the respondent should be dismissed. The appeal is accordingly allowed with costs. \n Civil Appeals Nos. 2516-2517 & 2519 of 1966 and Civil Appeals Nos. 806 and 807 of 1967 The question of law arising in these appeals has been the subject matter of consideration in Civil Appeal No.\n 2518 of 1966. For the reasons given in that judgment we hold that these appeals also should be allowed and the judgments of the Punjab High Court should be set aside and the writ petitions filed by the respondents in each case should be dismissed. These appeals are accordingly allowed with costs. There will be one hearing fee for these appeals and for Civil Appeal No. 2518 of 1966. \n Y.P.                              Appeals allowed.",

Colabawalla J. ]  1.        Admit. The Respondents through their respective counsel, waive service. By consent of parties made returnable forthwith and heard finally. These two Appeals take exception to the common order passed by the learned Single Judge dated 28th November, 2014 under which two Chamber Summons filed by the Appellant (original Defendant No.5) came to be dismissed . Chamber Summons No.748 of 2014 was filed by the Appellant inter alia seeking a direction that Respondent No.3 herein (original Defendant No.6) be ordered to pay to Respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein (original Plaintiffs) a sum of Rs.23,50,00,000/- and to ICICI Bank Ltd a sum of USD 17,000,000/- as per clause 11(a) read with clause 15 of the consent terms dated 28th September 2011, together with interest thereon at the rate of 6% p.a. from 31st October, 2011 till payment. Chamber Summons No.709 of 2014 was filed by the Appellant seeking a declaration that the consent decree dated 28th September, 2011 be marked as satisfied and the attachments levied on the movable and immovable properties belonging to Defendant Nos.1, 2, 4 and 5 be raised. The learned Single Judge, finding no substance in either of the Chamber Summons, dismissed the same by the impugned order. For the sake of convenience, we shall refer to the parties as they were arrayed before the Trial Court. \n 3.   The facts stated briefly are that the Plaintiffs had subscribed to certain convertible debentures issued by Defendant No.5. As the Defendants failed to honour their commitments, the Plaintiffs filed the above suit on 15th October, 2010 inter alia claiming certain sums of money from Defendant Nos.1 to 5. In the said suit, the parties entered into consent terms dated 28th September, 2011 wherein Defendant No.6 was joined as a party Defendant to the suit and Defendant Nos.1 to 5 submitted to a decree on admission in terms of prayer clauses (a), (c), (d) and (h) of the plaint. In the present Appeals, the controversy revolves around the interpretation of certain clauses of the said consent terms. The relevant clauses of the consent terms read thus :- \"4. Defendant No.5 is inter alia the owner of four rigs being Rig Nos.VIII, IX, X and XI more particularly described in Exh.'I' to the plaint. ICICI Bank through its security trustee namely, Unit Trust of India Advisory Services (UTI Advisory Services) has a first charge on the Rig Nos.VIII, IX, X and XI for the credit facilities extended to Defendant No.5 (First Charge) and the Plaintiff No.1 through Plaintiff No.2 as the Security and Debenture Trustee, has a second charge on Rigs Nos.VIII, IX, X and XI in respect of the FCD Investment (Second Charge). \n 5. In terms of the settlement arrived at between the parties, it is hereby decreed, agreed, declared and confirmed and Defendant Nos.1 to 5 undertake to this Hon'ble Court that Defendant No.5 shall - (a) sell and transer Rig No.X to Precision Machinery LLC ( a company incorporated under the laws of United Arab Emirates having its principal office at Ras Al Khor Industrial Area, Plot No.58, Street 13-b, Community 16, Al Aweer, Dubai, UAE) in terms of the sale deed to be executed between Defendant No.5 and Precision Machinery LLC in the form initialed by the parties for identification (Sale Deed for Rig No.X) for an agreed sale consideration of USD 11,111,110 (US Dollars Eleven Million One Hundred Eleven Thousand One Hundred Ten) witout any deduction or abatements; (b) subject to Clause 9 herein, sell and transfer Rig No.IX to Defendant No.6 for an agreed aggregate sale consideration of USD 17,000,000/- (US Dollars Seventeen Million) and USD equivalent of Rs.23,50,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Three Crores and fifty Lakhs) as on date of the sale, without any deduction or abatements; (c) grant lease in respect of Rig Nos.VIII and XI to Defendant No.6 in terms of the lease agreements to be executed between Defendant Nos.5 and 6 in the form initialed by the parties for identification (Lease Agreements) with a first option to Precision Machinery LLC and a second option to Defendant No.6 to purchase Rig Nos.VIII and XI in terms of the option agreements to be entered between Defendant Nos.5 and Precision Machinery LLC and initialed by the parties for identification (Option Agreements). \n 9. It is further agreed, declared and confirmed that the Defendant No.6 has an option to purchase Rig No.IX from Defednant No.5 for an agreed aggregate sale consideration of USD 17,000,000/- (US Dollars Seventeen Million) and USD equivalent of Rs.23,50,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Three Crores and fifty Lakhs) as on date of the sale, which it shall exercise on or before 31st October 2011, Defendant Nos.5 and 6 shall on or before 31st October 2011 execute a sale deed (Sale Deed for Rig No.IX). \n 10. It is agreed, declared and confirmed and Defendant Nos.1 to 5 undertake to this Hon'ble Court that Defendant No.5 shall - (a) on or before 7th October 2011 make an application to obtain from the Income Tax Authorities Certificate as required under section 281 of the Income Tax act 1961 for the sale and transfer of Rig No.IX to Defendant No.6 and provide to Defendant No.6 a duly acknowledged copy thereof; (b) on the execution of the Sale Deed for rig No.IX hand over all pertinent documents of title in respect of Rig No.IX and be provided an acknowledgment of the receipt thereof. \n 11.(a) On execution of the Sale Deed for Rig No.IX in favour of Defendant No.6, Defendant No.6 agrees and undertakes to this Hon'ble Court, that from the aggregate sale consideration of USD 17,000,000/- (US Dollars Seventeen Million) and USD equivalent of Rs.23,50,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Three Crores and fifty Lakhs) as on date of the sale, on or before 31 st october 2011, pay to ICICI Bank for and on behalf of Defendant No.5 a sum of USD 17,000,000/- (US Dollars Seventeen Million) and Plaintiffs for and on behalf of Defendant No.5 a sum of Rs.23,50,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Three Crores and fifty Lakhs). \n              On receipt of the said payments by ICICI Bank and the Plaintiffs, the First Charge of ICICI Bank and Second charge of the Plaintiffs on Rig No.IX shall stand released and extinguished and ICICI Bank and UTI Advisory Services and the Plaintiffs shall within two weeks thereof file the necessary forms with the Registrar of Companies, evidencing satisfaction of such charge. (b) It is also agreed, declared and confirmed and Defendant Nos.1 to 5 undertake to this Hon'ble Court that in the event sale of Rig No.IX to Defendant No.6 does not take place before 31st October 2011, Defendant No.5 shall sell Rig No.IX to a third party on or before 1st February 2012 after giving to the Plaintiffs and ICICI Bank at least fifteen days of advance written intimation of the proposed sale including all relevatn particulars of sale such as name, address and contact details of the proposed purchaser; the price at which the Rig No.IX is being sold and the date of the proposed sale. From the sale proceeds thereof, pay to Plaintiffs a minimum of 23.5% of the sale consideration, within a period of 10 days from the sale of Rig No.IX and whereupon the Second Charge of the Plaintiffs on Rig No.IX shall stand released and extinguished and the Plaintiffs shall within two weeks thereof file the necessary forms with the Registrar of Companies, evidencing satisfaction of such charge. \n (c) In the event, the Plaintiffs are not paid the entire sum of Rs.23,50,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Three Crores and Fifty Lakhs) for any reason whatsoever, then Defendant Nos.1 to 5 undertakes to this Hon'ble Court, to pay the balance amount on or before 31st January 2012. \n (d) It is hereby further agreed, declared, confirmed that in the event sale of Rig No.IX does not take place before 31st January 2012 or there is any shortfall as mentioned in sub-clause (c) hereinabove for any reason whatsoever, Defendant Nos.1 to 5 agree and undertake to this Hon'ble Court to pay to the Plaintiffs within a period of 24 months from 31st January 2012 a sum of Rs.23,50,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Three Crores Fifty Lakhs only) along with interest thereon @ 6 % per annum to be calculated from 1st February 2012 payable monthly. However, in the event Defendant No.5 does not have sufficient cash flows to make such interest payments, such interest will be accrued and payable from 1st February 2014. On receipt of the aggregate sum of Rs.23,50,00,000/- along with the entire interest thereon, as mentioned above, by the Plaintiffs, the Second Charge of the Plaintiffs on Rig No.IX shall stand released and extinguished and the Plaintiffs shall within two weeks thereof file the necessary forms with the Registrar of Companies, evidencing satisfaction of such charge.\" \n (emphasis supplied)  4.   It is common ground before us that the only dispute in the present case is with reference to sale of Rig No.IX which forms a part of the consent terms dated 28th September, 2011. After the consent terms were entered into, admittedly, there were defaults committed by Defendant Nos.1 to 5 inasmuch as the amount of Rs.23,50,00,000/- payable to the Plaintiffs and the sum of USD 17,000,000/- payable to ICICI Bank Ltd were in fact not paid. In view thereof, the consent terms were sought to be executed by the Plaintiffs by filing the above Execution Application. It is in this Execution Application, the Appellant (original Defendant No.5) filed the above two Chamber Summons seeking the reliefs as more particularly stated earlier. 5.   Dr. Sathe, the learned Sr. Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant (Defendant No.5), relied upon certain clauses of the consent terms and contended that the amounts of Rs.23,50,00,000/- and USD 17,000,000/- were payable by Defendant No.6 to the Plaintiffs and ICICI Bank Ltd respectively and therefore, the Plaintiffs could not look to Defenadant Nos.1 to 5 for recovery of the said amount of Rs.23,50,00,000/-. In this regard, he laid particular stress on clauses 5(b), 9 and 11(a) of the consent terms. Relying upon the aforesaid clauses, Dr.\n Sathe submitted that on the sale of Rig No.IX by Defendant No.5 to Defendant No.6, Defendant No.6 had agreed and undertaken, for and on behalf of Defendant No.5, to pay the amounts of Rs.23,50,00,000/- and USD 17,000,000/- to the Plaintiffs and ICICI Bank Ltd, respectively. Dr.\n Sathe submitted that even though a formal Sale Deed was not executed, Defendant No.6 had exercised its option to purchase Rig No.IX as contemplated under clause 9 of the consent terms and therefore, it was bound by the undertaking given by it under clause 11(a) to pay these amounts to the Plaintiffs and ICICI Bank Ltd. In support of his argument that Defendant No.6 had exercised its option to purchase Rig No.IX, Dr.\n Sathe relied upon several documents which are enumerated hereunder:- (i) an Investment Proposal dated 27th May, 2011 made by the Appellant (original Defendant No.5) showing Defendant No.6 as the investee and signed by the Appellant (original Defendant No.5), Defendant No.6 and the Plaintiffs respectively; (ii) an agreement dated 27th May, 2011 between the Appellant and Defendant No.6 under which the Appellant agreed to handover possession inter alia of Rig No.IX to Defendant No.6; (iii) the Bare Boat Lease Agreement dated 15th September, 2011 entered into between Defendant No.6 and one PT RADIENT UTAMA (PRU), a Company incorporated under the laws of Indonesia.\n (iv) Form No.8 filed by Defendant No.6 before the Registrar of Companies; (v) An inventory prepared on 17th October, 2011 by Defendant No.6 of Rig No.IX that was signed by Defendant No.6 as well as one Pernata Selares Mandiri (the original lessees of Rig No.IX); (vi) an e-mail dated 28th October, 2011 addressed by the attorneys of Defendant No.6 to Defendant No.6; and (vii) MOU dated 27th January, 2012 executed by certain third parties showing the Appellant and Defendant No.6 as parties. \n 6.    Relying upon the aforesaid documents and what was stated therein, Dr Sathe submitted that all these documents clearly establish that Defendant No.6 had exercised its option to purchase Rig No.IX from Defendant No.5 (Appellant) and only a formal Sale Deed remained to be entered into, which was not done. He therefore submitted that Defendant No.6 was bound by the undertaking given by it in the consent terms to make payment to the Plaintiffs in terms of clause 11(a) thereof. In view of the aforesaid undertaking, the Plaintiffs could not look to Defendant Nos.1 to 5 for the aforesaid payment, was the submission of Dr. Sathe. \n 7.   On the other hand, Mr Kadam, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for the Plaintiffs, submitted that the consent terms were absolutely clear in its terms which provided that in the event the Plaintiffs are not paid the entire sum of Rs.23,50,00,000/- for any reason whatsoever, then Defendant Nos.1 to 5 undertook to pay these amounts to the Plaintiffs on or before 31st January, 2012. He submitted that the Plaintiffs were not concerned with any inter-se dispute between Defendant Nos.1 to 5 and Defendant No.6 with reference to the sale of Rig No.IX. It was his contention that as per the consent terms, and more particularly clause 11(c) thereof, even if the sale of Rig No.IX had taken place as contemplated under the consent terms, and payments were not made by Defendant No.6, the Plaintiffs could look to Defendant Nos.1 to 5 for being paid the entire sum of Rs.23,50,00,000/- or any part thereof. He therefore submitted that there was no merit in both the Chamber Summons filed by Defendant No.5 and the learned Single Judge was fully justified in dismissing the same. He therefore urged that these appeals be dismissed with costs. \n 8.   Mr Narichania, learned Sr. Counsel appearing on behalf of Defendant No.6, contended that Defendant No.6 was involved in the proposal whereby the Appellant (Defendant No.5) was to sell four rigs (Rig Nos. VIII to XI) to Defendant No.6 for paying its debts inter alia to the Plaintiffs. At the time of discussions, it was revealed that Rig No.IX was stationed in Indonesia for a project of an Indonesian State owned Company viz. Pt. Pertamina Gaothermal Energy (PGE). The said PGE had awarded the contrtact to one Pt. Radiant Utama (PRU) who in turn had sub-contracted the work to National Drilling Services Company LLC and one Permata Selares Mandiri (Original Lessees). The Appellant had entered into a Bare Boat Agreement dated 19th May 2010 with the said Original Lessees and by virtue of the same, the said Rig No.IX was in their control and possession. As there were several disputes between Defendant No.5 and the Original Lessees, Defendant No.5 requested Defendant No.6 to help Defendant No.5 to start operations and settle the disputes, as only when the said disputes were settled, the purchase of Rig No.IX could make commercial sense and thereafter be considered. It was with this understanding that the document titled \"Investment Proposal\" dated 27th May, 2011 and which was relied upon by Dr. Sathe, came to be entered into. It was under this interim Agreement that Defendant No.6 had infused funds for starting operations of inter alia Rig No.IX. However, the said interim Agreement dated 27th May, 2011 further provided that it would stand terminated upon the execution of the definitive agreements as contemplated in the Investment Proposal or upon termination of the Investment Proposal itself. With the hope that with the intervention of Defendant No.6 the Original Lessees would be persuaded to settle their disputes with Defendant No.5, the Bare Boat Lease Agreement dated 15th September, 2011 came to be entered into between Defendant No.6 and PRU. Mr Narichania submitted that Defendant No.5 was well aware of the said transaction and permitted the same with the hope of the disputes being settled and thereby regain control over Rig No.IX. Mr Narichania laid specific stress on clause 19 of the Bare Boat Lease Agreement which sets out the condition precedent for the said Agreement to become effective. It reads thus:- \"19. Condition Precedent 19.1 This Agreement shall become effective upon the completion of the folowing condition precedents : Confirmation Letter signed by the Lessor and DRIPL regarding the transfer of ownership of the Rig to the Lessor; a. Confirmation Letter issued and signed by DRIPL regarding the cancellation of the First Lease.\"\n (emphasis supplied) 9 .            He submitted that admittedly, (i) the confirmation letter regarding the transfer of ownership of Rig No.IX to Defendant No.6; or (ii) the confirmation letter regarding cancellation of the First Lease; was never executed and / or issued by Defendant No.5. Therefore, the said Bare Boat Lease Agreement did not become effective as set out in clause 19 therein. \n He submitted that a one line statement in the said Agreement wherein it was stated that Defendant No.6 had purchased and acquired from Defendant No.5, Rig No.IX on 28th May 2011, was clearly erroneous. Mr.\n Narichania further submitted that looking at the consent terms, it was clear that on the date when the Bare Boat Lease Agreement was entered into (15th September, 2011), Defendant No.6 was not the owner of Rig No.IX. \nThis, according to him, has been affirmed by Defendant No.5 in the consent terms dated 28th September, 2011 and more particularly in clause 4 thereof. For all the aforesaid reasons, Mr Narichania submitted that they had never exercised their option to purchase Rig No.IX as contemplated under the consent terms and consequently they were not bound by the undertaking given by them under clause 11(a) thereof which required them to make payment of USD 17,000,000/- to ICICI Bank Ltd and Rs.23,50,00,000/- to the Plaintiffs. \n 10.   We have heard the learned counsel at great length and perused the papers and proceedings in the Appeals as well as the impugned order. \n From the facts as narrated above it is clear that the claims in the suit filed by the Plaintiffs were settled between the parties by entering into consent terms dated 28th September, 2011. Under the said consent terms, Defendant No.6 was joined as a party Defendant for the first time. Clause 11(c) of the consent terms in uneqvivocal terms states that in the event the Plaintiffs are not paid the entire sum of Rs.23,50,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Three Crores and Fifty Lakhs) for any reason whatsoever, then Defendant Nos.1 to 5 undertake to pay the balance amount on or before 31st January, 2012. It is not in dispute that the sum of Rs.23,50,00,000/- has in fact not been paid to the Plaintiffs. In this view of the matter, we are in full agreement with the submission of Mr Kadam that by virtue of clause 11(c), there is no question of (i) either forcing the Plaintiffs to look only to Defendant No.6 for recovery of this amount; or (ii) marking the consent terms / decree as satisfied. The undertaking given by Defendant Nos.1 to 5 in Clause 11(c) is clear and unequivocal, and they are bound by the same. \n 11.  In answer to this, Dr. Sathe submitted that clause 11(c) would come into play only if no sale was effected for Rig No.IX in favour of Defendant No.6. If the sale was effected of Rig No.IX in favour of Defendant No.6, then the Plaintiffs could look only to Defendant No.6 for recovery of the amount of Rs.23,50,00,000/- and could not look to Defendant Nos.1 to 5, was the submission. He submitted that clause 11(c) ought to be read subject to clause 11(a) of the consent terms. We cannot agree. The words used in clause 11(c) are unequivocal and clearly spell out the intention of the parties viz. that if for any reason whatsoever, the Plaintiffs are not paid the entire sum of Rs.23,50,00,000/-, in that event, Defendant Nos.1 to 5 undertook to pay the said amount or any part thereof to the Plaintiffs. If clause 11(c) was to come into operation only in the event of the sale not taking place of Rig No.IX to Defendant No.6, the consent terms would have so stated. That is admittedly not the case. In fact, the words \"for any reason whatsoever\" appearing in clause 11(c) make it clear that the Plaintiffs are primarily concerned with the payment of Rs.23,50,00,000/-. Only to facilitate this payment, clause 11(a) provides that on Defendant No.6 purchasing Rig No.IX, Defendant No.6 undertakes to pay this amount of Rs.23,50,00,000/- to the Plaintiffs directly. This does not in any way absolve Defendant Nos.1 to 5 to make payment of the aforesaid amount to the Plaintiffs. In this view of the matter, on this ground alone, we find that the learned Single Judge was fully justified in dismissing both the Chamber Summons. \n 12.  Having said this, we shall now examine whether in fact, Defendant No.6 had exercised its option to purchase Rig No.IX as contemplated under clause 9 of the consent terms, thereby binding them to the undertaking given in clause 11(a) thereof. \n 13.  As stated earlier, Dr. Sathe relied upon several documents to support his submission that even though no formal Sale Deed was executed with reference to the sale of Rig No.IX, Defendant No.6 had exercised its option to purchase the said Rig as contemplated under clause 9 of the consent terms. In order to deal with this submission, we shall presently deal with these documents individually. \n (i) Investment Proposal dated 27th May, 2011 made by the Appellant (original Defendant No.5) showing Defendant No.6 as the investee:- We find the reliance placed on this document by Dr.\n                       Sathe is wholly misplaced. This Investment Proposal is dated 27th May, 2011 which shows Defendant No.6 as the Investee. This Investment Proposal was signed by Defendant No.5, Defendant No.6 and the Plaintiffs. It was executed much prior to the consent terms dated 28th September, 2011 which gives the option to Defendant No.6 to purchase Rig No.IX. We therefore fail to see how a document executed on 27th May, 2011 can throw light on whether an option to purchase had been exercised under a subsequent document (viz. the consent terms dated 28th September, 2011). Even otherwise, nothing has been brought to our notice in the said document which would indicate that Defendant No.6 had in fact purchased Rig No.IX from Defendant No.5 prior to entering into the consent terms dated 28th September, 2011. The Investment Proposal has no reference to the agreement of the parties in the consent terms for sale of Rig No.IX or taking over the liability of Defendant No.5. We therefore find that the reliance placed on the Investment Proposal is of no avail to Defendant No.5 to contend that Defendant No.6 had exercised its option to purchase Rig No.IX on or before 31st October, 2011 as more particularly set out in the consent terms. \n (ii) Agreement dated 27th May, 2011 between the Appellant and Defendant No.6 under which the Appellant agreed to handover possession inter alia of Rig No.IX to Defendant No.6:- Firstly, even this document is executed long before the consent terms dated 28th September, 2011. Secondly, we find that this was only an Agreement handing over legal possession of Rig No.IX to Defendant No.6. It is not in dispute that actual control and possession of Rig No.IX was with the Original Lessees and continues till date. \n Under this Agreement, there is admittedly no transfer of ownership of Rig No.IX from Defendant No.5 to Defendant No.6. In this view of the matter, the reliance placed on this document is also wholly misplaced. \n (iii) The Bare Boat Lease Agreement dated 15th September, 2011 entered into between Defendant No.6 and one PT RADIENT UTAMA (PRU), a Company incorporated under the laws of Indonesia:- Dr. Sathe relied upon this Bare Boat Lease Agreement, and in particular clause 4 thereof, wherein it is stated that Defendant No.6 confirms that it has purchased and acquired from Defendant No.5 Rig No.IX on 28th May, 2011. Relying upon the aforesaid statement, Dr. Sathe contended that this clearly goes to show that Defendant No.6 had exercised its option to purchase Rig No.IX. \n We find this argument to be wholly fallacious for more than one reason. Firstly, despite the aforesaid statement, clause 19 of the said Agreement itself states that the said Agreement would become effective only on a confirmation letter being signed by Defendant No.6 and Defendant No.5 regarding the transfer of ownership of Rig No.IX. Admittedly, no such letter has been executed between Defendant No.5 and Defendant No.6. \n Secondly, it is important to note that the Bare Boat Lease Agreement is dated 15th September, 2011 whereas the consent terms entered into between the parties was dated thereafter i.e. 28th September, 2011. Clause 4 of the consent terms categorically states as under :- \"4. Defendant No.5 is inter alia the owner of four rigs being Rig Nos.VIII, IX, X and XI more particularly described in Exh.'I' to the plaint. ICICI Bank through its security trustee namely, Unit Trust of India Advisory Services (UTI Advisory Services) has a first charge on the Rig Nos.VIII, IX, X and XI for the credit facilities extended to Defendant No.5 (First Charge) and the Plaintiff No.1 through Plaintiff No.2 as the Security and Debenture Trustee, has a second charge on Rigs Nos.VIII, IX, X and XI in respect of the FCD Investment (Second Charge).\"\n  (emphasis supplied) Therefore, after entering into the Bare Boat Lease Agreement, in the consent terms, Defendant No.5 clearly reiterates that it is the owner of Rig No.IX and thereafter gives an option to Defendant No.6 to purchase the said Rig on or before 31st October, 2011. \n (see Clause 9 of the consent terms) . If the Rig had already been purchased by Defendant No.6 on 28th May, 2011 (as erronously set out in the Bare Boat Lease Agreement), there was no question of Defendant No.5 reiterating its ownership over Rig No.IX in the consent terms (dated 28th September, 2011), or giving an option to Defendant No.6 to purchase the said Rig on or before 31st October, 2011. Thirdly, as late as on 14th February 2013, Defendant No.5 has written a letter to ICICI Bank Ltd. once again reiterating their ownership over Rig No.IX. The relevant portion of the said letter reads as under :- \"I will not at this stage delve into the details, as the same is well documented. However, for no fault of ours and by circumstance we continue to remain owners of Rig IX, until the matter is resolved. Unfortunately, we are also on that account responsible for taking steps to secure the Rig. We have recently been informed by Ahmad Ganis of PRU that the Indonesian Custom authorities have served a notice on PRU to re-export the Rig, failing which the bond submitted by PRU to the Customs Authorities will be encashed. \n In view of securing the Rig, and without prejudice to our contentions, (as recorded in various communique including letters dated 21st May 2012, 23rd July 2012 and 24th September 2012) we set forth, for ICICI's information and consideration, the proposal made by Mr A. Ganis. \n Until the Rig, free from all encumbrances, is in the port of re-export or at Batam a buyer cannot be found for the rig; Therefore, he will at first in order to repossess Rig equipment taken by the creditors, negotiate with them to considerably reduce their claims, so that the contractual liability that affixes on PRU (which he has unfairly passed on to DRIPL) is below USD 3 million; ..........\n             .......... Once the Rig reaches port, AG has promised to assist in finding a buyer for the Rig (whilst DRIPL should make similar attempts) and from the sale consideration after making the aforesaid payments, the balance paid to ICICI.\" On perusing the said letter, it is clear that even as late as on 14th February 2013, Defendant No.5 reiterated that it continued to remain the owner of Rig No.IX. We therefore find that this document also does not carry the case of Defendant No.5 any further to indicate that Defendant No.6 had exercised its option to purchase Rig No.IX. As stated earlier, this Bare Boat Lease Agreement is also dated prior to the date of the consent terms and it would be unrealistic to contemplate a situation whereby the option to purchase was exercised even before that option was actually made available to Defendant No.6 under the consent terms. (iv) Form No.8 filed by Defendant No.6 before the Registrar of Companies:- Reliance placed by Dr. Sathe on this document is totally misconceived. Form 8 is filed pursuant to sections 125, 127, 132 and 135 of the Companies Act, 1956 which has been filed by Defendant No.6. This document, at clause 15(i) states as under :- \"a. rigs means collectively (i) National 1320 UF ACASCR 2000 HP (Rig 9) proposed to be purchased by the borrower\".\n  Furthermore, clauses 16(a) and (b) of Form 8 states that the Rig in question (Rig No.9) is registered in the name of Defendant No.5. We therefore fail to see how this document is of any assistance to Defendant No.5 to contend that Defendant No.6 had exercised its option to purchase Rig No.IX. In fact, this document indicates otherwise. (v) An inventory prepared on 17th October, 2011 by Defendant No.6 of Rig No.IX that was signed by Defendant No.6 as well as one Pernata Selares Mandiri (the original lessees of Rig No.IX):- We find that the reliance placed on this document is wholly misconceived. This is merely an inventory of Rig No.IX and in no way indicates either the title passing to Defendant No.6 or the fact that they had exercised their option to purchase Rig No.IX from Defendant No.5 on or before 31st October, 2011. (vi) E-mail dated 28th October, 2011 addressed by the attorneys of Defendant No.6 to Defendant No.6:- This is an e-mail written by the attorneys of Defendant No.6, to Defendant No.6 asking them to send their official letter to Defendant No.5 prior to 31st October, 2011 exercising their option to purchase Rig No.IX as per the provisions of the consent terms. The reliance placed on this e-mail by Dr. Sathe is also wholly misconceived. It must be stated that this e-mail was not produced before the learned Single Judge to suggest that the option to purchase was in fact exercised by Defendant No.6. This e-mail has been produced for the first time before us. Be that as it may, even reading the said e-mail, we find that all it states is asking Defendant No.6 to send an official letter to Defendant No.5 exercising its option to purchase Rig No.IX prior to 31st October, 2011 as per the provisions of the consent terms. Admittedly, no such letter has been written by Defendant No.6 to Defendant No.5. In this view of the matter, this e-mail does not carry the case of Defendant No.5 any further. \n (vii) MOU dated 27th January, 2012 executed by certain third parties showing the Appellant and Defendant No.6 as parties. \n            The reliance placed by Dr. Sathe on this MOU is also wholly misplaced. This MOU has not been signed either by Defendant No.5 or Defendant No.6 and neither do the contents thereof state that Defendant No.6 had exercised its option to purchase Rig No.IX on or before 31st October, 2011. \n 14.  We therefore find that even otherwise, Defendant No.6 never exercised its option to purchase Rig No.IX on or before 31st October, 2011 as contemplated under clause 9 of the consent terms. This being the case, there was no question of Defendant No.6 having to pay the aggregate sale consideration of USD 17,000,000/- to ICICI Bank Ltd. and Rs.23,50,00,000/- to the Plaintiffs, for and on behalf of Defendant No.5. \n 15.       It is pertinent to note that clause 11(a) begins with the words \"On execution of the Sale Deed for Rig No.IX in favour of Defendant No.6, Defendant No.6 agrees and undertakes to this Hon'ble Court, ...........\". It is an admitted fact that no Sale Deed has been executed between Defendant No.5 and Defendant No.6 with reference to Rig No.IX. In the absence of a Sale Deed as contemplated under clause 11(a) of the consent terms, it would be unfair to enforce the undertaking against Defendant No.6 to pay the amounts of USD 17,000,000/- to ICICI Bank Ltd. and Rs.23,50,00,000/- to the Plaintiffs, respectively. These amounts represented the sale consideration for Rig No.IX, and not having exercised its option to purchase it, Defendant No.6 cannot be asked to pay these amounts. \n 16.       For all the aforesaid reasons, we find no merit in these Appeals and the same are dismissed. The Appellant (Original Defendant No.5) shall pay costs of Rs.50,000/- to the Plaintiffs, and Rs.50,000/- to Defendant No.6 in each of the Appeals. \n CHIEF JUSTICE B.P. COLABAWALLA, J.",

Upadhyay, fo the Respondent. \n\n                              CORAM: F.I. REBELLO &\n                                           R.S.MOHITE, JJ. DATED: 20TH MARCH, 2009\nORAL JUDGMENT (PER F.I. REBELLO, J.)  .  The Appellant a non-banking financial company has approached this Court against the order dated 13th August, 2008 passed by the I.T.A.T. for the assessment year 2001-2002. The A.O. by his order had directed that loss of Rs.6,00,877/- in share trading, was a speculation loss by virtue of Explanation to Section 73 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 . In respect of the said disallowance and on some other aspects, the assessee preferred an Appeal before C.I.T. (A). C.I.T. (A) by its order was pleased to observe that the business of the appellant consists of trading and investment in shares, debentures, bonds, mutual funds and other securities pursuant to      its Memorandum of Association. The Tribunal considering the arguments was pleased to place reliance on the order of the Delhi Bench in Aman Portofolio Pvt. Ltd., 92 ITD 324 (Delhi) as also the clarification issued by C.B.T.D.'s Circular No.204 dated 24th July, 1976 and held that the A.O. was not justified to treat the loss in shares as speculative loss and accordingly the disallowance on that count was deleted . Revenue aggrieved by the said order preferred an Appeal before the I.T.A.T. The Tribunal noted that the Tribunal had taken the decision in the case of High Power Motors Pvt. Ltd. in ITA No.2094/Mum/2004 vide order dated 8th May, 2008. It also placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Chainrup Sampathram 24 ITR 481 where the Supreme Court had taken a view that loss or profit on account of valuation of closing stock has to be treated as speculative loss and allowable as revenue loss or revenue receipt as the nature of these profits are similar to the nature of business in trading of shares and for that reason allowed the appeal filed by the Revenue and set aside the order of C.I.T. (A). \n 2.  The assessee is in appeal on four questions. \n In our opinion the following two questions would arise for consideration:- (i)Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Tribunal was justified in treating Rs.6,00,877/- as speculation loss by dint of the Explanation to Section 73 of the Act?\n (ii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Tribunal was correct in treating the loss Rs.6,00,877/- originating from and traceable simply and barely to the valuation of stock of shares as covered by the ken of the Explanation to Section 73 of the Act?\" \n 3.  At the hearing of this Appeal on behalf of the Appellant-Assessee, learned Counsel submits that in so far as Question (i) is concerned, the Explanation has to be read with Circular No.204 and if so read it would be clear that the object of the provisions is to curb the device sometimes resorted to, by business houses controlling groups of companies to manipulate and reduce the taxable income of companies under their control. It is submitted that it is not the contention of the Revenue that the Assessee controls the group companies and the transactions were done to manipulate and reduce the taxable income of the companies under their control. \n .        On the other hand on behalf of Revenue, learned Counsel submits that the language of the Explanation to Section 73 is clear. It is further submitted that no doubt the Circular has been issued. However, it is for the Court to decide the true effect of the Explanation to Section 73 and the effect of the Circular. \n 4.       The explanation to Section 73 as introduced by the Taxation Law (Amendment) Act, 1973 read as under:- Explanation.-- Where any part of the business of a company (other than an investment company, as defined in clause (ii) of Section 109, or a company the principal business of which is the business of banking or the granting of loan and advances) consists in the purchase and sale of shares of other companies such company shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be carrying on a speculation business to the extent to which the business consists of the purchase and sale of such shares.\" \n 4.  The Statement of Objects and reasons provide as under:- \"2. The main objectives of the amendments proposed to be made are to unearth black-money and prevent its proliferation; to fight and curb tax evasion; to check avoidance of tax through various legal devices, including the formation of trusts and diversion of income or wealth to members of family; to reduce tax arrears and to ensure that in future, tax arrears do not accumulate; to rationalise the exemptions and deductions available under the relevant enactments, and to streamline the administrative set-up and make it functionally efficient.\" The relevant provision of Section 73 as it now stands reads as under:- Losses in Speculation business. \n \"73(1) Any loss, computed in respect of a speculation business carried on by the assessee, shall not be set off except against profits and gains, if any, if another speculation business.\n (2) ........\n (3) ........\n (4) No loss shall be carried forward under this section for more than (four) assessment years immediately succeeding the assessment year for which the loss was first computed. \n Explanation.-- Where any part of the business of a company (other than a company whose gross total income consists mainly of income which is chargeable under the heads \"Interest of securities\", \"Income from house property\", \"Capital gains\" and \"income from other sources\") or a company the principal business of which is the business of banking or the granting of loans and advances) consists in the purchase and sale of shares of other companies, such company shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be carrying on a speculation business to the extent to which the business consists of the purchase and sale of such shares.\" \n 5.  A perusal of the explanation would, therefore, make it clear that where any part of the business of the company consists in the purchase and sale of shares of other companies, for the purpose of Section 73 such company shall be deemed to be carrying on speculation business. On consideration of the said provision considering the language of the Explanation there is atleast no scope for ambiguity. The language of the Explanation is clear, in as much as a company carrying on business of purchase and sale of shares shall be deemed to be carrying on speculation business. \n .  Our attention was invited to Circular No.204. The Circular contains the explanatory notes to Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 1975. Para.19.1 deals with the treatment of losses in speculation business. In so far as this paragraph is concerned there is no dispute in respect of its language wherein it uses the following expression:- \"The amending Act has added an Explanation to Section 73 to provide that the business of purchase and sale or shares by companies which are not investment or banking companies or companies carrying on business of granting loans or advances will be treated on the same footing as a speculation business.\" \n Learned Counsel, however, relies on paragraph 19.2. \nParagraph 19.2 reads as under:- \"The object of this provision is to curb the device sometimes resorted to by business houses controlling groups of companies to manipulate and reduce the taxable income of companies under their control.\" \n It appears from this paragraph in the explanatory note in respect of the amending Act that the argument advanced on behalf of the assessee by their Counsel may merit some consideration. In our opinion, however, a gainful reading of paragraphs 19.1 and 19.2 read with language of the Explanation would not bear out the submission as made on behalf of the Assessee. Para.19.1 as we have noted earlier does not refer to group companies, but refers to companies dealing with shares. It is in that context para.19.2 may be considered to mean that it also includes cases of such group companies. That does not mean that the explanation to Section 73 must be restricted only to group companies and not to other companies who carry on business of sale and purchase of shares either having no controlling interest in other companies or purchasing shares to control other companies. Once the language is clear the Court must give effect to the language for its true interpretation. If the language is in conflict with the Circular then to that extent to ignore the circular. The Circular cannot be read in the manner sought to be argued on behalf of the assessee as that would defeat the very object as set out in the statement of object and reasons to the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 1973. In the light of the above, the Tribunal was right in taking the view it has taken. The first question is accordingly answered against the assessee. \n 6.  The learned Counsel then sets out that even if the question (i) is answered in favour of the assessee nevertheless the explanation specifically refers to purchase and sale of shares of any other companies and does not refer to losses suffered on account of book valuation. Our attention is invited to Section 43(5) which reads as under;- \"speculative transaction\" means transaction in which a contract for the purchase or sale of any commodity, including stocks and shares, is periodically or ultimately settled otherwise than by the actual delivery or transfer of the commodity or scrips.\"\n  Our attention is also invited then to Section 28 Explanation 2 which reads as under:- \"Where speculative transactions carried on by an assessee are of such a nature as to constitute a business, the business (hereinafter referred to as \"speculation business\") shall be deemed to be distinct and separate from any other business.\" \n Explanation 2, to Section 28, therefore, treats the business in respect of speculative transactions to be distinct and separate from any other business. \nSection 43(5) holds those transactions to be speculation respect of which a settlement is otherwise periodically or settled other than by delivery or transfer of the commodity or scrips. \nReading these provisions learned Counsel submits that the 'speculative value' would not fall within the explanation. \n 7.  Our attention is first invited to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal vs. Hind Construction Ltd., 83 ITR 211 to contend that if a person revalues his goods and shows higher value for them in his books he cannot be considered having sold his goods and made profits therein. The issue before the Supreme Court was in respect of sale of machinery. The Court there held that there was no sale.  That judgment, therefore, would really of no   much assistance We next consider the judgment of the Supreme Court in Chainrup Sampatram vs. Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal, 24 ITR 481, where the Supreme Court observed that the valuation of unsold stock at the close of an accounting period is a necessary part of the process of determining the trading results of that period and can in no sense be regarded as the source of such profits. The Supreme Court in Sanjeev Woolen Mills vs.\n Commissioner of Income Tax, 279 ITR 434 (S.C.) considered the judgment in Chainrup Sampatram (supra) for the purpose of considering the rational behind valuation of the stock at market whichever is earlier. \n 8.  On the other hand on behalf of the Revenue the learned Counsel has drawn our attention to the finding recorded by the Tribunal as also to the observations in Sanjeev Woolen Mills (supra) to contend that there is nothing inconsistent in the said judgment of the view taken by the Tribunal. 9.         In our opinion there can be no difference between the losses suffered in the course of trading by delivery and losses in terms of the book value. As long as the assessee is carrying on business of trading by way of purchase and sale of shares even if in respect of any financial year, there are no transaction and yet the company has stock in trade of shares, the book value will have to be considered for the purpose of considering the profit and loss in case of speculative business. There can be no doubt that the explanation to Section 73 cannot be read to mean only when there is a purchase and sale of shares in the course of the financial year. The explanation will cover both shares which are stock in trade and shares which are traded in the course of the financial year for the purpose of considering the loss and profit for that year. The Tribunal, in our opinion, has correctly answered the issue by holding that the loss of profit on account of valuation amounts to revenue losses or revenue receipt. The second question, therefore, also will have to be answered against the assessee and in favour of the Revenue. \n 10.  For the aforesaid reasons we find no merit in this Appeal which is accordingly dismissed. \n (R.S.MOHITE, J.)  (F.I.REBELLO, J.)",

It was granted registration under Section 12-A of the Income Tax Act,1961 on 21-7-1986. It was also granted recognition under Section 80-G (5)(vi) of the Act Income Tax Act, for the year 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008. Returns were being filed regularly. On 1-1-2009 the assessee filed an application in Form 80-G of the Income Tax Act, 1961 seeking renewal of the recognition. The Director of Income Tax,(Exemptions) rejected the application. Aggrieved by the same, the assessee preferred an appeal before the Tribunal. The Tribunal by its order vide Annexure-A, expressed a doubt whether the assessee is entitled even for the benefit under Section 11-A and therefore the matter was remanded. On remand, the Commissioner passed an order on 31-8-2009 rejecting the application for renewal of recognition under Section 80-G. Aggrieved by the same, the assessee preferred an appeal before the Tribunal. The Tribunal dismissed the appeal. Hence, this appeal. By the order dated 8-11-2010 the appeal was admitted to consider the following four substantial questions of law:- \"i) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Honourable Tribunal was right in law in holding that the Appellate Trust is not eligible for renewal of approval under Section 80G? \n ii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law failing to hold that the Appellant Trust is eligible for automatic renewal of approval under section 80G? \n iii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in perversely holding that the Appellant Trust was not engaged in charitable activity? \n iv) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in directing the lower authority to relook at the registration granted under section 12A and thereby exceeding the jurisdiction of section 254(1)?\" The learned counsels submit that the substantial questions of law require to be re-framed. We have heard learned counsels on the same. On hearing learned counsels, we are of the view that the following substantial question of law arises for consideration: \" Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the Appellate Trust is not eligible for renewal of approval under Section 80G?\" The learned counsel for the assessee contends that the Commissioner committed a gross error in rejecting the application for renewal. That the Commissioner placed reliance on the conditions as laid down under Section 80- G(5)(ii) and came to the conclusion that the income was not being used for charitable purposes. Therefore, the Commissioner held that there is an absence of charitable activity. That the activity of the Trust is not in consonance with the objects of the Trust. That only some percentage of the income is used for a charitable purpose. \n 2. The learned counsel for the revenue contends that what is being used by the assessee towards the object of the Trust is very miniscule. That most of the income that is used is only as a result of letting-out of the building, for business purposes. That it is not the object of the Trust at all. \n 3. The same is countered by the learned counsel for the assessee on the ground that the condition as specified in Section 80-G(5)(ii) postulates that income could be used for charitable purposes. That letting out of the property is not barred by law. That the figures as narrated in the order of the Commissioner is not the complete reflection of facts. He places reliance on the returns filed which would indicate that Rs.16,15,878/- was repaid for the current year towards repayment of the principal amount of the loan borrowed for the financial year 2005-06 and for that Rs.9,19,422/- is paid towards interest. The income used is Rs.26,10,821/-. The deduction made is Rs.7,61,000/-. Therefore, the finding of the Commissioner is not appropriate in view of the material on record. That the factum of repaying the principal has not been considered by the Commissioner. \n 4. Be that as it may, we are of the considered view that the consideration of these factors when an application for renewal has been made cannot be the considerations before the authority. The only condition that requires to be fulfilled for the purposes of seeking renewal are as specified under Section 80-G(5)(ii) and the clauses narrated therein. That none of the clauses in Section 80-G(5)(ii) would be said to be applicable herein. \nIt only postulates that any income derived from the charitable trust may be used for charitable purpose. \nTherefore, the rejection of the application is inappropriate. \nHowever, we are of the considered view that this consideration can only be made, during the assessment proceedings. The question whether renewal is justified or not, is not necessary to be considered at this stage. The applicability of the income of the assessee whether it is for charitable purposes or not are all questions of fact and necessarily can be gone into by the assessing authority at the time of assessing the income of the assessee. \n Therefore, it is needless to state that the assessing authority shall look into all the material placed in order to ensure that the income is used for a charitable purpose in accordance with law. \n Under these circumstances, the substantial question of law is answered by holding that the Tribunal was not right in law in holding that the appellant Trust was not eligible for renewal for approval under Section 80-G.\n Consequently, the order of the Tribunal is set aside. The substantial question of law is accordingly answered. \n The appeal is disposed off accordingly. \n SD/-   SD/- JUDGE   JUDGE rsk/-",

KVAT/AP-125/07- 08/APRIL 2006 TO MARCH 2007, ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE. THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR HEARING, THIS DAY, G.NARENDAR J., MADE THE FOLLOWING: ORDER The appellant (assessee henceforth) is before this court being aggrieved by the order of the first respondent in proceeding No.SMR/KVAT/GLB/CR173/ 09-10 dated 11.1.2012 and for a further prayer to restore the rectification order passed by respondent No.2 in appeal No.KVAT/AP-125/07-08/April 2006 to March 2007 and to grant such other orders, reliefs in the facts and circumstances of the case. \n 2. The facts of the case in a nutshell is as follows : The appellant is a dealer in electronic goods carrying on business under the name and style M/s.S.B.Audio and Video. It has been assigned TIN No.29130258009. The appellant files the return in form VAT 100 before the Assessing Authority i.e. the 3rd respondent herein. On assessment the 3rd respondent arrived at a conclusion that the appellant has claimed exemption in respect of discounts granted subsequent to the issuance of tax invoice and concluded that the same is not in consonance with the provisions of Rule 3(2)(c) of the KVAT Rules 2005 (hereinafter referred to as `the Rules 2005' for brevity and convenience). As a consequence of the above conclusion, the Assessing Authority passed an order under Section 39(1) of the KVAT Act (hereinafter referred to as `the Act' for brevity and convenience) disallowing the discount paid subsequent to the issue of tax invoices and levied tax and penalty amounting to Rs.45,128/- by order dated 20.10.2007. \n 3. The appellant being aggrieved, unsuccessfully appealed to the First Appellate Authority which dismissed the appeal by its order dated 22.4.2008. It is contended that thereafter the appellant once again filed a rectification appeal before the very same First Appellate Authority and the said rectification application came to be allowed by order dt. 13.3.2009. \n 4. The first respondent exercising suo motu powers appears to have reopened the case and treating it as a revision issued notices to the appellant calling for objections and after detailed hearing restored the order of the Original Authority i.e. the Assessing Authority by the impugned order 11.1.2012. \n 5. A perusal of the records reveals the follows : The third respondent on the direction of the Commissioner of Commercial taxes appears to have got issued a notice dt. 4.9.2007 in Form 275 calling upon the appellant herein to submit the books of accounts. In response to the same the appellant is stated to have sought two months time to submit the details, on the ground, that the books of accounts have been sent for auditing and thereafter the appellant/assessee submitted the requisite information in Form-100. After re-assessment the Assessing Authority levied a sum of Rs.45,128/- as additional tax and penalty for the Assessment Year ending March 2007. Aggrieved by the same the assessee preferred an appeal under Section 62 of the Act impugning the assessment order under Section 39(i) (a) of the Act.\n 6. In the first appeal it is contended that the Assessing Authority has erred in disallowing the discount allowed by the assessee and failed to see that the discounts allowed is as per the KVAT Act. It was contended that their sellers had given them discount of Rs.2,22,942/- and according to their regular practice prevailing in the business they had in turn given discounts to the tune Rs.5,33,445/- as permitted under the provisions of Sub Rule (2)(C) of Rule 3 of the Rules 2005 and that there is no bar to allow more discount to the customers; that the disallowance of the discount over and above the discounts received by them is illegal. \nIt is contended that they have given discounts to the sub dealers and retailers at the end of the year and had issued credit notes and recorded the same in their books of accounts. While issuing credit notes they had bifurcated the value into discount and VAT element and they had also filed their returns and declared it in their income tax statement also. The above contention prima facie appears to be illogical as it borders on bad business practices. \n 7. The first appellate authority while concluding the appeal was pleased to arrive at the finding that discounts are allowable, but such discounts are to be in consonance with the regular trade practice or regular business practice of the assessee or ought to be evidenced by the terms of any contract of agreement and it must also be demonstrated by the assessee that the purchaser had paid the originally charged sum less the discount. It is the finding of the First Appellate Authority, that in the case of the assessee, the buyers have originally paid tax on the entire amount including the tax component, and at the end of the year refunds, in the form of additional discounts, cash discounts, incentives etc. has been given by the assessee in the form of credit notes and this methodology/practice adopted by the assessee is not in consonance with law and the said ground the appeal came to be rejected by order 22.4.2008. \n 8. After the lapse of nearly 6 months from the passing of the order it is stated that the counsel for the assessee is said to have appeared and pleaded that the tax has to be levied on the real and actual value of sale and not on the notional value. Apart from that it has been additionally argued for the first time that whenever their sellers allow certain discounts, additional discount, incentives etc., the same were passed on to their local retailers by issue of credit notes and that too within a period of 6 months. This plea that they were in receipt of \"discounts, additional discount, incentives etc.\" is a new plea. On a casual examination, prima facie this plea appears to go against the assessee's own declaration wherein he had only declared a total discount Rs.2,22,942 as discount received from his sellers. If this new plea is to be accepted then prima facie it appears that the assessee has suppressed the so called `discounts, additional discount, incentives etc.\"\nin the original returns filed by him. Be that as it may, this court due to the lack of records cannot delve into the same. Further, it being an issue in the factual context, the same has to be gone into and determined by the authorities. \n 9. In the above rectification proceedings it has been further argued that the provisions of Section 3 (3) makes it mandatory to declare such credit notes and that the order in appeal has been passed ignoring the import of the provisions of Section 30(1) r/w. Rule 31 of the Rules and they being substantive provisions which provide for allowance of discounts by the dealer and such discounts having been given by the assessee, the assessment ought to have been on the lesser or actual value after giving credit to the discounts. It is further alleged in the `rectification of mistake apparent petition' that though the books of accounts and relevant documents (no details of the same are forthcoming) were placed before the first appellate authority, the order was passed ignoring the same. 10. Thereafter the assessee having made a statement about the scheme of the Act, provisions of law and the broad principles of settled Law which governs the subject matter, has contended that the earlier order in appeal suffers from an error apparent on the face of the records. Thereafter the assessee has listed several citations and has also extracted several provisions but has nowhere pleaded or placed on record the actual facts and details of the case to which the broad principles or settled principles of law could be applied nor is there any pleading which factually contradicts the original assessment by the assessing authority. In effect the rectification application appears to be rehearing of the first appeal and is not an application for rectification of any mistake apparent on the face of the records. In fact it is acknowledged by the first appellate authority in his own words as follows :- \"In view of the new dimensions that emerges now the appeal order dt.22.4.2008 appears to be an order passed with mistaken notion and resultant decision a mistake appearing on records\" \n 11. The first appellate authority has virtually admitted that he has reviewed his own order. The issue whether it is permissible in law and the Appellate Authority is competent to review is a matter that does not fall for consideration by this Court and this court need not dwell upon the same. The First Appellate Authority after reviewing was pleased to set aside the discount disallowed and invoking the provisions of Sub Section (2) of Section 72 ordered penalty of Rs.3,881/- to be deleted exercising his powers of rectification under Section 69 of the Act. \n 12. The First Appellate Authority while passing the rectification order has no where referred to the factual material placed before the Authority. What were the documents examined by him? Whether the tax invoices as mandated under Rules 27 and 29 of the Rules were looked into by him? Whether credit and debit notes as mandated under Rule 31 of the Rules were looked into by him. It is also not forthcoming as to whether the rectification order is passed after adverting to the contents of the credit and debit notes and tax invoices or after a comparative assessment of the same. \n 13. The revision is heard by the Revisional Authority i.e. the Additional Commissioner of Commercial taxes, Zone-1, Bengaluru. The Revisional Authority after hearing the parties has been pleased to hold that the rectification order by the First Appellate Authority is not sustainable in the eye of law and it deserves to be set aside as it is erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of Revenue. While so doing he adverts to certain provisions of law. But yet again the Revisional Authority has fallen into the same error as committed by the First Appellate Authority. He has not adverted to any material particulars or factual aspects of the case and has approached the matter in a perfunctory manner. \n 14. The Original Authority, the First Appellate Authority and the Revisional Authority are to be faulted for the only reason that they have not adverted to the factual materials and particulars of the case which was their bounden duty. The Authorities have ventured into the exercise of interpretation of the provisions and application of broad principles as laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court. It is an undisputed fact that the law as laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and by this Court, the interpretation placed on the statute or a principle of law enunciated are precedents and binding on the authorities but it is also an undisputed fact and declared law that the same are evolved in a particular set of facts and the said precedent is applicable in similar set of facts. The broad principles of law as laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court or by this Court has to be applied in full force but after adverting to the material facts of each case, which exercise the authorities have failed to adhere to. In these facts this Court has been pleased to formulate the following questions of law :- (A) Whether it was within the competence and authority of the Additional Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Zone-I to have treated rightly the judgment dated 16.02.2010 passed by the Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court in STRP No.117 to 121/2008 in the case of the State of Karnataka V/s M/s Reliance Industries Ltd., (2010 (68) KAR LJ 602) as a mere order without following the said judgment? \n (B) Whether it is permissible for the assessee to show the discount given by a separate credit not subsequently and claim deduction even though the said discount is not shown in the tax invoice or sale bill? \n After hearing, the additional substantial question of law has been framed i.e.\n `Whether it is permissible for the Appellate Authority or the Tribunal to render a finding merely on the broad principles of law and precedents without adverting to the factual aspects and material particulars of a case? \n 15. The counsel for the petitioner has relied on catena of judgments rendered by this Court in STRP No.119/2008 in the case of State of Karnataka  vs - Reliance Industries Ltd; In STA No.71/2010 between M/s.Pratham Motors Pvt.Ltd  vs  Addl. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes; STRP No.51/2009 and Civil Appeal Nos.2516-17/2012 rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in M/s.IFB Industries case. \n 16. The respondents also placed reliance on the judgment of this Hon'ble Court in STRP No.84/2009 & 71-76/2010. 17. Adverting to the first substantial question of law there cannot be any dispute that any judgment rendered by this Court cannot be treated lightly by the Subordinate Authorities, be it the Tribunal or the Revisional Authority or the First Appellate Authority or the Revisional Authority. Every judgment and order emanating from the Hon'ble Apex Court and this Court is binding on the above authorities and the authorities are required to follow the precedents in the event they are applicable to the facts of the said case. Accordingly, the first substantial question of law is answered accordingly. 18. As regards the second question of law, the issue has been settled by the Apex Court in the above referred case of IFB Industries Ltd. Though the Apex Court was dealing with the case arising out of General Sales Tax Rules of Kerala but the provisions being in paramateria, the principle laid down by the Apex Court is applicable in the facts of the case. That apart, the provisions of the Sales Tax Rules particularly Rule 31 empowers the dealer to give further discounts in the form of credit notes and debit notes. The provisions enabling the issuance of credit and debit notes is made subject to the provisions of Rule 30 of the Rules. \n 19. It is seen that Rule 3 deals with determination of total and taxable turn over. Clause (c) of Sub Rule (2) refers to all amounts allowed as discounts. Hence there can be no dispute that the taxable turnover is the net amount after allowing discounts permissible under law and the discounts ought to be given in the manner prescribed in law. \n 20. In the instant case as noted above, there has been no exercise undertaken by the authorities to verify the material particulars of the returns submitted by the assessee. It is also not demonstrated by the assessee as to what is the material he has placed before the authorities and this Court is constrained to observe that both the parties have failed to place on record the material particulars that ought to have been considered and nothing is forthcoming as to what has been appreciated in the instant case. \n 21. The Rules specify, particularly Rule 27, that the dealer must issue a tax invoice in respect of every sale, be it taxable goods or exempted goods along with taxable goods where the value of goods is in excess of Rs.100/-. Rules 28 stipulates that the tax invoice ought to be in duplicate. Thereafter Rule 29 mandates the particulars that a tax invoice must reveal or disclose. \nRule 30 stipulates the particulars to be furnished in a bill of sale and Rule 31 stipulates the particulars that ought to be revealed in a debit and credit note. Thus we conclude that the dealer is entitled to give further discounts even after the sale has been completed provided the discounts are the customary practice in the trade or otherwise known as trade discounts. It has to be demonstrated by the assessee that the further discounts, apart from the discounts in the tax invoice or sale bill already given, is pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement or contract between the seller and the registered dealer. For Eg. a contract may be entered into for providing further discounts in the event if the dealer achieved a particular target or exceeds a particular target. Thus to concise the same this Court is of the opinion that a discount is allowable under the tax invoice or sale bill. A further discount is also permissible by way of credit note and debit note subject to the condition it is demonstrated that the discounts are trade discounts or pursuant to a contract or agreement entered into between the seller and the dealer. The onus of proving the said fact is on the assessee and he ought to demonstrate that the discount given by him is in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Rules. Thus the second substantial question of law is answered accordingly. \n 22. As regards the third substantial question of law (as framed now), the same has been framed in the facts and circumstances as noted by the Court in the case on hand. The authorities must primarily embark upon a detailed discussion of the factual aspects and material facts of the case. In the instant case the authorities have not endeavored to state as to what is the documents inspected by them, whether they have made a comparative assessment of the tax invoice and sale bills with the credit and debit notes under which the appellant is claiming to have given the discounts to his purchasers. It is also not forthcoming whether the monthly returns as mandated under Rule 38 of the Rules have been verified before arriving at the conclusion. \n 23. We conclude that the authorities are required to state the facts and the material particulars and thereafter apply the precedents to the said facts and circumstances before rendering a finding. \n 24. In view of the above discussion the following order. \n Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after perusing the records before this Court, it is not in dispute that the impugned orders do not reveal as to what are the details that were placed by the assessee before the Authorities and what are the details that the authorities verified before concluding the assessment. The records do not reveal if the assessee has formulated any incentive scheme or that he has entered into any contract or agreement with the purchasers and that the credit notes issued by him are in pursuance of the incentive scheme or the contract or agreement. The proceedings also do not reveal as to whether the assessee has placed before the authorities the tax invoices, sale bill and monthly returns along with the credit and debit notes. It is incumbent upon the assessee to place the aforesaid records before the authorities and the authorities ought to consider the same and thereafter render a finding. This Court after perusal of the records is convinced that such an exercise is not forthcoming from the records. Under the circumstance, this Court is of the considered opinion that it is a fit case to be remanded to the Assessing Authority with a direction to the appellant/assessee to furnish all details as discussed above and thereafter the Assessing Authority shall reconsider the entire matter in the light of the said provisions and pass fresh orders in accordance with law. To enable the same the order dated 13.03.2009 and 11.01.2012 are set aside. \n For the aforesaid reasons the above appeal is disposed of. \n Sd/- JUDGE Sd/- JUDGE rs",

HEADNOTE: The respondent-assessee was one of the partners In a\n\nfirm in which the five other partners were his wife, mother,\ngrand-father, brother, and a stranger. His wife had contrib-\nuted Rs.51,000 as capital in the firm, which amount came out \nof two gifts made to her by the assessee . in the course of\nassessment proceedings for the assessment year 1962-63 in\nrespect of the assessee, the Income Tax Officer included the\nprofits of the assessee's wife from the firm, under s.\n64(1)(iii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The.assessee's\nappeal was dismissed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner\nwho observed that the wife would not have become a partner\nof the firm unless he had contributed capital which was\nprovided by the husband. The Appellate Tribunal, while\ndismissing the second appeal of the assessee, found that the\nadmission of the assessee's wife as a partner in the firm\nwas solely on account of her contribution of capital to the\nfirm. It was conceded by the assessee before the Tribunal\nthat the interest received by the assessee's wife on her\ncapital contribution to the firm was includible in the total\nincome of the assessee. \n\n       The High Court, while answering the question referred to\nit in favour of the assessee, took the view that the income\narose from the share of profits only because the other\npartners agreed to take the assessee's wife as partner and\nshe was allowed to contribute to the partnership firm, and\nthat the admission of the assessee's wife to the partnership\nwas not in consequence of the gift.\nDismissing the Revenue's appeal, it was\n\n       HELD: (1) The income may arise directly or indirectly,\nbut for application of the provisions of section 64(1)(iii)\nof the Income Tax Act, \n738\n1961 there must be a proximate connection between the accru-\n\nal of the income and the assets transferred by the assessee.

From the Judgment and Order dated the 24.4.1973 of the Calcutta High Court in Income Tax Reference No. 202 of 1969. \nB. Ahuja and Ms. A. Subhashini for the Appellant. \n K.P. Bhatnagar, S.P. Mittal and B.P. Maheshwari for the Respondent. \n The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATHAK, CJ. This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of the High Court at Calcutta answering the following question in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue: \"Whether, on the facts and in the circum- stances of the case, the share of profit of the assessee's wife was includable in the total income of the assessee under section 64(1)(iii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961?\" \n739 The assessee was assessed in the status of an individual for the assessement year 1962-63 corresponding to the previ- ous year 26 March, 1961 to 13 April, 1962. At the material time the assessee was a partner in a firm, Messrs Ramesh and Co., with a share of eight annas therein. The balance was shared by three other partners, the assessee's father, Kunjilal Agarwala, the assessee's brother, Hariram Agarwala and a stranger, Jagdish Prasad. On 10 November, 1960 and on 28 November, 1960 the assessee made two gifts of Rs.21,000 and Rs.30,000 respectively to his wife, Kaushalya Devi, from his account in the firm. On 28 November, 1960 he made anoth- er gift of Rs. 11,000 to his mother Chili Bai from that account. It may be observed that Chili Bai received another gift of Rs.20,000 from her husband, Kunjilal, effected by similarly drawing from his account with the firm. \n       The assessee's wife, Kaushalya Devi, as well as his mother Chili Bai became partners with three other persons in a newly constituted firm, Messrs Kunjilal Hariram & Co. The three other partners were the assessee's grand father, Moharilal Agarwala, the assessee's brother, Hariram Agarwala and the stranger, Jagdish Prasad Gup. ta. The Partnership Deed dated 10 November, 1960 provided that the business was to commence from 12 November, 1960. The preamble to the deed stated: \"Whereas the partner of the Fifth Part who has extensive experience and outstanding talent of organisation in Jagree and Grains Trade but little finance requested the partners of the First four Parts to enter into co-partnership with him on contributing the necessary finance to carry on business in Jagree and Grains and also act as Commission Agents in Jagree Grains and allied commodities to which request they acceded.\" \n                         Clause 4 of the Partnership Deed stipulated: \"That the partners of the First Four Parts shall initially contribute Rs.25,000 each to be put in within six months from the commence- ment of the partnership. The said contribu- tions augmented by further deposits and prof- its or depleted by withdrawals and tosses shall carry interest at the rate of 6% per annum. The amount if any, standing to the credit of the partner of the Fifth Part shall carry interest at the same rate.\" 740 On 12 November, 1960 Kaushalya Devi contributed Rs.21,000 as capital, which came out of the gift made by the assessee on 10 November, 1960. She also contributed Rs.30,000 as capital, which amount came out of the gift made on 28 November, 1960. \n       In the course of assessment proceedings for the assess- ment year 1962-63 in respect of the assessee the Income Tax Officer included the profits of the assessee's wife from the firm, Messrs. Kunjilal Hariram & Co., under s. 64(1)(iii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. An appeal by the assessee was dismissed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, who observed that the wife would not have become a partner of the firm unless she had contributed capital, and as the capital was provided by the husband the inclusion of the wife's share of income in the assessment of the assessee was justified. \n       In second appeal, it was conceded by the assessee before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal that the interest received by the assessee's wife on her capital contribution to the firm was includible in the total income of the assessee, but it was contended that the balance of the share of profit was not so includable as the assessee's wife had become a part- ner in the firm in her own right, and it was immaterial that the capital invested by her had been provided as a gift by the assessee. The Appellate Tribunal found that the admis- sion of the assessee's wife as partner in the firm was solely on account of her contribution of capital to the firm, that the assets in the form of cash were transferred directly by the assessee to his wife otherwise than for adequate consideration, and that the income must be said to have arisen indirectly from the assets transferred. The second appeal was dismissed. At the instance of the assessee the question of law set forth earlier was referred to the High Court at Calcutta for its opinion. \n       The High Court has taken the view that the share of profits arose to the assessee's wife primarily because the partnership made a profit and although it had connection with the gift it did not arise as a result of the gift, that the income arose from the share of profits only because the other partners agreed to take the assessee's wife as partner and was allowed to contribute to the partnership firm, that the admission of the assessee's wife to the partnership was not in consequence of the gift, and that, therefore, upon all those circumstances, the connection between the income of the share of profits and the gifts by the assessee to his wife was too remote to be included within the provisions of s. 64(1)(iii) of the Income Tax Act. \n 741 S.64(1)(iii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, as it stood at the relevant time, provides: \"64(1) In computing the total income of any individual, there shall be included all such income as arises directly or indirectly-- (i) xx    xx       xx (ii) xx   xx       xx (iii) subject to the provisions of cl.\n (i) of s. 27, to the spouse of such individual from assets transferred directly or indirectly to the spouse by such individual otherwise than for adequate consideration or in connec- tion with an agreement to live apart.\" \n The income may arise directly or indirectly, but there must be a proximate connection between the accrual of the income and the assets transferred by the assessee. In Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal 111 v. Prem Bhai Parekh and Others, [1970] 77 ITR 27 this Court held that the income of minor sons, who had invested capital in the firm out of moneys gifted to them by their father (the assessee) could not be included in the assessment of the assessee. The Court observed: \"Before any income of a minor child can be brought within the scope of section 16(3)(a) (iv), it must be established that the said income arose directly or indirectly from assets transferred directly or indirectly by his father. There is no dispute that the assessee had transferred to each of his minor sons, a sum of Rs.75,000. It may also be that the amount contributed by those minors as their share in the firm came from those amounts. But the question still remains wheth- er it can be said that the income with which we are concerned in this case arises directly or indirectly from the assets transferred by the assessee to those minors. The connection between the gifts mentioned earlier and the income in question is a remote one. The income of the minors arose as a result of their admission to the benefits of the partnership. \n It is true that they were admitted to the 742 benefits of the partnership because of the contribution made by them. But there is no nexus between the transfer of the assets and the income in question. It cannot be said that income arose directly or indirectly from the transferor the assets referred to earlier. \n Section 16(3) of the Act created an artificial income. That section must receive strict construction as observed by this court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Keshavlal Lal- lubhai Patel, [1965] 55 ITR 637 (S.C.). In our judgment before an income can be held to come within the ambit of section 16(3), it must be proved to have arisen-directly             or indirectly--from a transfer of assets made by the assessee in favour of his wife or minor children. The connection between the transfer of assets and the income must be proximate. \n The income in question must arise as a result of the transfer and not in some manner con- nected with it.\" \n It seems to us that the observations of this Court in that case fully cover the case before us. There is no doubt that the wife became a partner because of the capital contributed by her in the firm, but, as observed by the High Court, in the judgment under appeal, it was upon agreement by the remaining partners that she became a member of the partner- ship. The mere contribution of the capital by the wife into the firm would not automatically have entitled her to part- nership in the firm. The partnership was based on agreement, and it is the event of agreement between the partners that brought the assessee's wife into the firm as partner. Learned counsel for the Revenue relies on Commissioner of Income-tax, Bangalore v. J.H. Gotla, [1985] 156 ITR 323; Commissioner of Income-tax, Assam Tripurn and Manipur v.\n Jwalaprasad Agarwala, [1967] 66 ITR 154; V.D. Dhanwatey v.\n Commissioner of Income-tax, Madhya Pradesh, Nagpur and Bhandara, [1968] 68 ITR 365 and Smt. Mohini Thapar v. Com- missioner of' Income-tax (Central), Calcutta, and Others, [1972] 83 ITR 208 but we are not satisfied that those cases are of assistance to the Revenue. Reliance was placed on Potti Veerayya Sresty v. Commissioner of Income-Tax, A.P., [1972] 85 ITR 194 where the Andhra Pradesh High Court upheld the inclusion of the wife's income from cloth business carried on by her, into which cloth business she had invest- ed a portion of the assets transferred by the assessee. It is sufficient to observe that the cloth business was her own business and, as the High Court pointed out, there was no necessity to depend upon the agreement of others. It is on that basis that the High Court distinguished Prem Bhai Parekh's case (supra). \n 743 We are of the view that the High Court is right in answering. the . question referred to it in the negative, in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue. \n In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\n R.S.S.                    Appeal dismissed.",

An offence under section 466 I.P.C is covered by\nclause (c) of section 195(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code\nand comes within the purview of that section, as the offence\nunder section 463 I.P.C. is dealt within section 466 I.P.C.\nSection 466 I.P.C. is on aggravated form of forgery in that\nthe forgery should relate to a document specified in that\nsection. Section 466 I.P.C., is therefore an offence as\ndescribed in section 463 I.P.C. which is committed in\nrelation to a record or proceeding of or in a court of\njustice. [390F, H, 391 A-B] \n\n         The offences that fall within the purview of section\n\n\n195(1)(c) Criminal P C. are offences described in section\n463 I.P.C. and offences punishable under section 471, 475 or\n476 of the Penal Code. The language of section 195(1) (c) of\nthe Crl. P.C. is very significant for while referring to\nsections 471, 475 or 476 I.P.C., it uses the word punishable\nin the case of section 463 I.P.C. the words are 'the\noffences described in section 463'. An offence under section\n466 I.P.C. is an offence which falls within the description\nof section 463 I.P.C., as the offence under section 463\nI.P.C. is dealt with therein. [391B-D]\n\n         Section 195(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code uses\nthe words \"of any offences punishable under section 172..\"\nwhile in clause (b), the words used are \"offences punishable\nunder any of the following sections mentioned therein\". In\nclause (e) the words are \"of any offence described in\nsection 463 or punishable under section 471, section 475 or\nsection 476 of the same code\". Thus a clear distinction is\nmaintained in the section between offences\n386\npunishable under various sections mentioned and the offence\ndescribed in section 463. Even on the test laid down in\nGovind Mehta v. State of Bihar [1971] Suppl. S.C.R. 777,\nsection 466 I.P.C. would be included within the purview of\nsection 195(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The requirement; of section 195 (1)(c) is that the\ndocument in question should be produced or given in evidence\nin the proceeding before the Court. The offence committed\nmust in some manner have affected the proceedings or had\nbeen designed to affect them or come to light in the course\nof them, but an offence committed after their conclusion is\nwholly outside the scope of the provision.

[393A]\n\nJUDGMENT :         CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No.\n 144 of 1972. \n         Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 1-2-1972 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Criminal Revision No. 709/71. \n R. Nagarathnam for the Appellant. \n         S. K. Gambhir, Miss B. Ramrakhiani and J. M. Khanna for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAILASAM, J. This appeal is preferred by Dr. S. L.\nGoswami by special leave granted by this Court against the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur in Criminal Revision No. 709 of 1971. Criminal Revision No. 709 of 1971 was filed by the appellant 387 before the High Court for quashing the order of the Magistrate, 1st , Class, Jabalpur committing the appellant to Sessions for trial under section 466 read with section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. The appellant was prosecuted before the Special Judge, Jabalpur, in Criminal Case No. S of 1967 for an offence under section 5 (1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, in connection with the defalcations of Government funds. In that case one Dr. S. C. Barat was examined as a defence witness . The appellant was convicted and an appeal against his conviction before the High Court failed. The appellant obtained special leave from this Court to appeal against the order of the High Court. During the pendency of the appeal before the Supreme Court the High Court was required to prepare a paper book for use in the Supreme Court. It is alleged that when the paper book was being prepared in the Supreme Court section of the High Court the appellant Dr. Goswami entered into a conspiracy with two of the translators and tampered with the original deposition of Dr. S. C. Barat, D.W. 1. The Additional Registrar of the High Court field a complaint before the First Class Magistrate, Jabalpur, against the appellant for an offence under section 466 read with section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. The case was taken on file by the Magistrate as Criminal Case No. 1924 of 1971. Against the two persons who were alleged to have conspired with the appellant in tampering with the deposition of Dr. Barat a challan was filed by the police before the same First Class Magistrate. \nThe Magistrate by a common order on 15th November, 1971 committed the appellant as well as two others to the Sessions Court to take their trial for offences under section 466 read with section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. The appellant and another with whom we are not concerned preferred a revision petition against the order of his committal before the High Court. The High Court dismissed the Fr revision filed by the appellant and hence this appeal. The main contentions that are raised in this appeal are: (i) The Magistrate erred in taking cognizance of an offence under section 466 of the Indian Penal Code read with section 120-B, Indian Penal Code. without sanction of the Government under section 196-A (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code; and (2) the offence, if any, was not committed in any court in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in such proceeding as required under section 195(i) (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We will take up the first contention urged by the learned counsel for 11 the appellant, namely that the trial court was in error in taking cognizance of the offence without a complaint by the State Government when the 388 offence charged is one of conspiracy under section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code as required under section 196-A(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Section 196-A(2) reads as follows:- \" 196-A. No court shall take cognizance of the offence! of criminal conspiracy punishable under section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. \n (1) * * * * (2) in a case where the object of the conspiracy is to commit any non-cognizable offence, or a cognizable offence not punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards unless the State Government, or a Chief Presidency Magistrate or District Magistrate empowered in this behalf by the State Government had by order in writing consented to the initiation of the proceedings; Provided that where the Criminal Conspiracy is one to which the provisions of sub-section (4) of section 195 apply no such consent shall be necessary. \"\n Section 466 deals with a non-cognizable offence and the sub-clause (2) to section 196A provides that where the object of the conspiracy is to commit a non-cognizable offence an order in writing consenting to the initiation of proceedings is necessary by the State Government or the Chief Presidency Magistrate or the District Magistrate empowered in this behalf by the State Government. No such consent in writing was obtained in this case. An exception to this requirement is Made by the Proviso which states that if the criminal conspiracy is one to which the provisions of sub-section (4) of section 195 apply no such consent shall be necessary. It is, therefore, necessary to determine whether the offence complained of is one that falls under section 195(4) in which case consent for initiation of the proceedings is not necessary. \n Section 195(1) (c) and section 195(4) which are necessary for the discussion may be extracted. \"195. (1) No Court shall take cognizance- (a) *            *         *             * (b) *           *         *            * (c) of any offence described in Section 463 or punishable under Section 471, Section 475 or Section 476 of the same Code, when such offence is alleged to have been 389 committed by a party to any proceeding in any Court in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in such proceeding, except on the complaint in writing of such Court, or of some other Court to which such Court is subordinate. (2) *           *                   *           * (3) *           *                   *           * (4) The provisions of sub-section (1), with reference to the offences named therein, apply also to criminal conspiracies to commit such offences and to the abetment of such offences, and attempts to commit. (5) *           * *            * Sub-section (4) makes the provisions of sub-section (1) with reference to the offences named applicable to criminal conspiracy to commit such offences also. If the offence falls under provisions of subsection (1) to Section 195 then criminal conspiracy to commit such offences would also fall under section 195(1) and require the complaint in writing by the court before the offence can be taken cognizance of. The requirements of section 195(1)(C) are: (1) The offence must be one as described in section 463 or punishable under sections 471, 475 or 476 of the I.P.C.\n (2) Such offences Should be alleged to have been committed by a party to any proceeding in any court; (3) Such offence should be in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in such proceeding. \n The offence for which the appellant is committed to take his trial is that there was consent of the appellant also in committing the conspiracy for committing forgery of the record by tampering the evidence of Dr. Barat while the records were being prepared by the High Court for being sent to the Supreme Court for use in the appeal pending before the Supreme Court. \n The first requirement is that the offence should be one as described in section 463 or punishable under section 471, section 475 or section 476 of the Indian Penal Code. It was submitted that as section 466, Indian Penal Code, is not one of the sections mentioned, the offence will not fall under the provisions of section 195(1) (c) 390 and the section will not apply. In support of this view a decision of his Court in Govind Mehta v. State of Bihar(1), was relied on. In that case, on a complaint by the District Public Prosecutor the appellant before this Court was committed to the Sessions to take trial under sections 167, 466 and 467 of the Indian Penal Code. One of the contentions raised before this Court was that the offence under section 466, Indian Penal Code, is not covered by clauses (b) and (c) of section 195(1) and therefore section 195 does not operate as a bar to taking cognizance of an offence under section 466, Indian Penal Code. this Court after agreeing with the view of the High Court that section 195(1) (b) or (c) is no bar to the Magistrate taking cognizance for an offence under section 167 observed: \"The offence under section 466 of the Penal Code is, admittedly, not covered by clause (b) or clause (c) of section 195(1) of the Code. \ntherefore, that section does not operate as a bar in respect of this office.\" Again at p. 785 this Court observed: \"Section 463 of the Penal Code is, no doubt, taken in by Clause (c) of Section 195(1) of the Code. Even on the basis that Section 465 of the Penal Code will also be covered by Clause (c) as the offence, under Section 463 is dealt with therein, nevertheless, Clause (c) will not operate as a bar to the jurisdiction of the Magistrate in taking cognizance of the said offence is not alleged to have been committed 'by a party to any proceeding in any court..' We have also referred to the fact that the appellant has been committed only for the offence under Sections 167, 466 and 471 of the Penal Code. Section 465 of the Penal Code is not the subject of the committal order.\" We have given our careful consideration to the view expressed in the above decision that section 466 of the Indian Penal Code is not covered by clause (c) of section 195(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. \nWe regret our inability to subscribe to this view. At p.785 of the Report the Court took the view that the section 465 of the Indian Penal Code is not specifically mentioned in section 195(1) (c) of the Criminal Procedure Code as the offence under section 463 Indian Penal Code is dealt with in section 465, Indian Penal Code, clause (c) of section 195(1) will not operate as a bar to the Magistrate taking cognizance the offence. The Court, though section 465 is not specifically mentioned in section ;195(1) (c), held that section 195(1) (c) Is applicable as an offence under section 463 is dealt with under section 465, Indian Penal Code. On the same reasoning section 466 should also be held to come within the purview of section 195(1)(c), Criminal Procedure Code, as the offence under section 463 is dealt with in section 466. Section 463, Indian Penal Code, defines forgery. The elements of (1) [1971] Supp. S.C.R. 777. \n 391 forgery are: (1) The making of a false document or part of it; (2) Such making should be with such intention as is specified in the section. Section 464 states when a person is said to make a false document which is one of the requirements under section 463. Section 465 provides the punishment for an offence under section 463. Section 466 is an aggravated form of forgery in that the forgery should relate to a document specified in the section. One of the documents specified is a document purporting to be a record or proceeding of or in a Court of Justice. Section 466, Indian Penal Code, is therefore an offence as described in section 463 which is committed in relation to a record or proceeding of or in a court of justice. The offences that fall within the purview of section 195(1)(c) are offences described in section 463 and offences punishable under sections 471, 475 or 476 of the Indian Penal Code. The language of section 195(1)(c) is very significant for while referring to sections 474, 475 or 476, Indian Penal Code, it uses the word publishable, in the case of section 463 the words used are the 'offences described in section 463'. An offence under section 466 is an offence which falls within the description of section 463 as the offence under section 463 is dealt with therein. Section 195(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code uses the words \"of any offence punishable under section 172\" while in clause (b) the words used are \"offence punishable under any of the following sections\"\nmentioned therein. In clause (c) as already pointed out the words used are \"of any offence described in section 463 or punishable under section 471, section 475 or section 476 of the same Code\". Thus a clear distinction is maintained in the section between offences punishable under various sections mentioned and the offences described in section 463. Even on the test laid down by this Court in Govind Mehta v. State of Bihar (supra) section 466 would be included within the purview of section 195(1) (c). We are, therefore, of the view that the decision that section 466 of the Indian Penal Code is not covered by clause (b) or clause (c) of section 195(1) is erroneous and not good law. The question of law was not considered and the decision was reached on an admission made by the parties. \n We will now deal with the other requirements of section 195 (1) (c) namely that The offence should be alleged to have been committed by a party to any proceeding and that it should be in respect cf a document produced or given in evidence in such proceeding. It is admitted that the appellant was a party in the appeal that he preferred against his conviction before the High Court but the appeal was decided against him and the conviction confirmed. \nSpecial leave was granted against his conviction and for hearing of the appeal before the 392 Supreme Court the paper book was being prepared by the High Court. It was during that time that it is alleged that the appellant entered into a conspiracy and tampered with the evidence of one of the defence witnesses which is a record of the court. The appellant was a party to a proceeding in the High Court when the appeal was heard but the document complained of as having been tampered with i.e. the evidence of the defence witness, was not produced or giver in evidence in the appeal before the High Court. The document was certainly not produced or given in evidence in the High Court proceedings. The alleged tampering was after the hearing of the appeal was concluded. No doubt, the tampering was in a proceeding in relation to the preparation of the record whether such tampering would be in relation to a proceeding in Supreme Court in respect of a document produced or given in evidence before it does not arise for consideration before us as the complaint in the case is filed only by the High Court. In Abdul Khader and ors. v.\n Meera Saheb(1) a Bench of the Madras High Court held that where a decree against Certain defendants had been passed upon the oath of the plaintiffs and where 'the documents alleged to be forgeries have been put into Court but were not given in evidence it would not be an offence committed by a party lo any proceeding in any court in respect of a document given in evidence in such proceeding though the documents were put in court in a suit pending before it but were not given in evidence Subsequent to this decision section 195(1)(c) was amended so as to include documents \"produced\" in addition to documents given in evidence. In Pendyala Subbarayudu v. (Gudivada) Gopayya(2) if was held that it was indispensable that the offence committed must in some manner have affected the proceedings or had been designed to effect them or come to light in the course of them but an offence committed after their close is wholly outside the scope of the provision. We agree with the view expressed in the decision. In Nirmaljit Singh Hoon v. The State of West Bengal and Anr.(3) it was held that a document produced in a proceeding before the court during the investigation by the police ordered under section 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code would not be a document produced ill a proceeding before the court so as to attract the ban under section 195(1) (c) of the Criminal Procedure Code. \n This Court in a recent decision in Legal Remembrancer of Government of West Bengal v. Haridas Mundra(4) held that the requirement of section 195(1) (c) is that the document in question should be produced or given in evidence in the (1) I.L.R. 15 M d. 224.\n (2) A.l.R. 1932 Mad. 290.\n (3) [1973] 2 S.C.R. 66.\n (4) [1976] 2 S.C.R. 933.\n 393 proceeding before the court. We find on the facts of the case that it has not been established that the document was produced or given in evidence in a proceeding before the court. The requirements of section 195(1)(c) having not been satisfied a complaint by the court in writing is not necessary. Equally, under sub-section (4) to section 195 relating to criminal conspiracy to commit such offence a complaint by the court is not necessary. Therefore, section 196-A(2) is attracted and a complaint by the State Government or the Chief Presidency Magistrate or a District Magistrate compowered in this behalf by the State Government in writing consenting to the initiation of the proceedings for an offence under section 120-B, Indian Penal Code is necessary. As in this case no such order consenting to the initiation of proceedings was passed we accept the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence against the appellant. In the result, we allow the appeal, reverse the judgment of the High Court and quash the order of committal passed by the Magistrate. First Class, Jabalpur. \n S.R.

In this appeal preferred by the Collector, Central Excise, Bombay under Section 35(L) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'), the question is whether the distillation and recrystallisation carried out by the respondent amounts to 'manufacture'? The respondent, M/s. S.D.Fine Chemical Pvt.Ltd., arc engaged in the manufacturing of laboratory chemicals and fine chemi- cals. They also undertake repacking and purification of laboratory and fine chemicals. In the classification list filed by them on April 1, 1983, they claimed that the process of purification and distillation undertaken by them does not amount to process of manufacture and accordingly, claimed exemption from duty in respect of such goods under Notification No. 77 of 1983 dated March 1, 1981 The Assistant Collector agreed with the respondent but his order was revised by the Collector (Appeals who held that the processes undertaken by the respondent do amount to manufacture. Inasmuch as a new commodity known to the market emerges as a result of such processes, he held, they are liable to excise duty. The respondent filed an appeal before the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tri- bunal, New Delhi which was heard in the first instance by a Bench of two Members. The Member (Technical) agreed with the respondent. The held that the processes undertaken by the respondent is merely for improving the quality or purity of the chemicals and does not amount to...... fracture. He observed that even after purification, the chemicals are, known by the very same name and that there was no change in the chemical formula even after purification. The simple process of distillation and recrystallisation of the chemi- cals does not amount to manufacture for the purposes of the Act, he held. The Member (Judicial) however, took a con- trary view. The was of the opinion that the process undertaken by the respondent is not a simple process and that the said process \"brings in a transformation which will change the name, character and use\". The Member (Judicial) further observed, \"the ordinary chemicals cannot be used in laboratory without it undergoing purification. They are traded in different commercial name and has altogether different use. So long as the trade recognises it as a different commodity and its uses are different, the item has to be recognised as a different goods and became excisable goods\". In view of the difference of opinion between the two Members, the matter was referred to a third Member. The third Member held in favour of the respondent manufacturer on the following reasoning \"As can be gathered, the key test is 355 whether the commodity which is subjected to the process of manufacture can no longer be regarded as the original commodity. In my view in the instant case this test has not been satisfied as the chemicals prior to the two processes concerned herein continues to remain the same after being subjected to the processes, admittedly with only a change in increase in purity. The commodity retains its identity substantially through the processing stage. Therefore, it cannot be said to have been manufactured.\" \n2. it would be evident from the opinion of the third Member that he did not deal with the several aspects dealt with in the opinions of the two differing members. He did not also indicate whether he agrees or disagrees with the findings recorded by the Member (Judicial), viz., that after the processes undertaken by the respondent, the chemicals bear a different chemical name and have an altogether dif- ferent use. The third Member did not also deal with the holding of the Member (Judicial) that after the processes undertaken by the respondent, the chemical became a different commercial commodity. 3. The expression 'manufacture' is defined in clause (f) of Section 2 of the Act The definition, as substituted by Finance Act (No. 25) of 1975, with effect from March 1, 1975 reads thus: \" manufacture' includes any process,- (i)incidental or ancillary to de completion of a manufactured product; (ii)which is specified in relation to any goods in the Section or Chapter notes of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 as amounting to manufacture, and the word 'manufacture' shall be construed accordingly and shall include not only a person who employs hired labour in the production or manufacture of excisable goods, but also any person who engages in their production or manufacture on his own account.\" 4. The definition is thus an inclusive definition. The purpose of the definition is to include certain processes and activities within the ambit of the said definition which may not otherwise amount to manufacture, as ordinarily understood. This inclusion is in addition to the normal meaning and context of the expression ,manufacture'. The said expression has been the subject matter of several deci- sions of this Court to which a brief reference is necessary to bring out the principles enunciated therein. In Union of India v. Delhi Cloth and General Mills (1963 Suppl (1) S.C.R.586) the revenue wanted to levy a duty upon 'refined oil' which was obtained by the respondent-manufacturer at an intermediate stage of production of vanaspati. The respondent cleansed the oil purchased by him by applying certain processes and thus obtained 'refined oil'. But the respondent did not apply the process of deodorisation before hydrogenating the refined oil. The case of the Revenue was that even non-deodorised refined ground-nut/til oil is 'refined oil' as known to the consumers and the commercial community. The respondent's case, however, was that the 'refined oil' as known to the consumers and the commercial community is necessarily the deodorised refined oil. After referring to the material produced by both the parties, this Court upheld the respondent's contention and held that \"without deodorisation, the oil is not 'refined oil' as is known to the consumers and the com- 356 mercial community',. This Court further held \"that the raw oil purchased by the respondent for the purpose of manufac- ture of vanaspati does not become at any stage 'refined oil' as is known to the consumers and the commercial community\" .\nFor this reason, it was held that refined oil obtained by the respondent at stage anterior to hydrogenation is not 'vegetable nonessential oil' or by 'all sorts' in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power within the meaning of Item 12 of the 1st Schedule to the Act. So far as legal position is concerned, this Court stated it in the following words: \"Excise duty is on the manufacture of goods and not on the sale. Mr. Pathak is therefore right in his contention that the fact that the substance produced by them at an immediate stage is not put in the market would not make any difference. If from the raw material has been brought into existence a new substance by the application of processes one or more of which are with the aid of power and that substance is the same as \"refined oil\" as known to the market an excise duty may be leviable under Item 23 (the present item 12)-. \n5. The Court then dealt with the next argument of the appellant-Union of India that even if it is held that the respondent did not manufacture 'refined oil' as known to the market, even so they must be held to manufacture some kind of 'non-essential vegetable oil' within the meaning of Item 23. This Court rejected the said argument with reference to the meaning of the expressions \"manufacture\" and \"goods\", in the following words: \"The word \"manufacture\" used as a verb is generally understood to mean as 'bringing into existence a new substance' and does not mean merely 'to produce some change in a substance,' however minor in consequence the change may be. This distinction is well brought about in a passage thus quoted in Permanent Edition of Words and Phrases, Vol.\n                         26 from an American Judgment. The passage runs thus:- 'Manufacture' implies a change, but every change is not manufacture and yet every change of an article is the result of treatment, labour and manipulation. But something more is necessary and there must be transformation; a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name, character or use'.\" \n 6. The Court then referred to and dealt with the meaning                          'Manufacture of expression 'goods' occurring in Section 3 and observed thus: \"These definitions make it clear that to become \"goods\" an article must be something which can ordinarily come to the market to be bought and sold. This consideration of the meaning of the word \"goods\" provides strong support for the view that \"manufacture\" which is liable to excise duty under the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 must be the 'bringing into existence of a new substance known to the market'. \"But\", says the learned counsel, \"look at the definition of \"manufacture\" in die definition clause of the Act and you will find that \"manufacture\" is defined thus: ' includes any process incidental or ancillary to the completion of a manufactured product. [S.2(f)]. \"\n                         We are unable to agree with the learned counsel that by inserting this definition of the word \"manufacture\" in S.2(f) the legislature intended to equate \"processing\" to \"manufacture\" and intended to 357 make mere \"processing\" as distinct from \"manufacture\" in the same sense of bringing into existence of a new substance known to the market, liable to duty. The sole purpose of inserting this definition is to make it clear that at certain places in the Act the word 'manufacture' has been used to mean a process incidental to the manufacture of the article. \n                         Thus in the very item under which the excise duty is claimed in these cases, we find the words: \"in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power.\" The definition of 'manufacture' as in S.2(f) puts it beyond any possibility of controversy that if power is used for any of the numerous processes that are required to turn the raw material into a finished article known to the market the clause will be applicable; and an argument that power is not used in the whole process of manufacture using the word in its ordinary sense, will not be available. It is only with this limited purpose that the legislature, in our opinion, inserted this definition of the word 'manufacture' in the definition section and not with a view to make the mere \"\n                         processing\" of goods as liable to excise duty. \n                         - 7. In South Bihar Sugar Mills Ltd. & Anr.Etc. v. Union of India & Anr. (1968 (3) S.C.R. 2 1), the above interpretation was affirmed. 8. In Empire Industries Ltd. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. (1985 (3) S.C.C.314) the question arose whether the process of bleaching, dyeing, printing of grey cloth amounts to 'manufacture' as defined in the Act. It may not be necessary to set out the reasoning in this case inasmuch as the very same question was considered later by a Constitution Bench of this Court in M/s. Ujagar Prints & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. (1989 (3)S.C.C.488). We will, therefore, refer to the reasoning in Ujagar Prints. The facts in Ujager Prints, were these: the customers supplied the grey fabric to the appellant who carried out operations of bleaching, dyeing, printing, glazing, shrink- proofing etc. against payment of processing charges. The ownership of the cloth rested with the customers who got these processes done to their specifications from the ap- pellant on payment of processing charges. The question was whether the appellant can be said to ham: undertaken 'manufacture' as defined in the Act. M.N. Venkatachahah, J, as the then learned Judge was dealt with several decisions of this Court including those referred to above as well as the decisions rendered by this Court under different Saks Tax enactments [including M/s. Tungabhadra Industries Ltd.\n Vs. Commercial Tax Officer, Kurnool (1961 (2) S.C.R.14)] and enunciated the principle in the following words: .LM15 \"The prevalent and generally accepted test to ascertain that there is \"manufacture\" is whether the change or the series of changes brought about by the application of processes take the commodity to the point where, commercially, it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but is, instead, recognised as a distinct and new article that has emerged as a result of the processes. The principles are clear. But difficulties arise in their application in individual cases. There might be borderline cases where either conclusion with equal justification be reached. \n Insistence on any sharp or intrinsic distinction between 'processing' and 'manufacture', we are afraid, results in an oversimplification of both and tends to blur their interdependence in cases such as the present one. \"\n 9.     The learned Judge then dealt with 358 argument that if the expression 'manufacture' defined under Section 2(f) of the Act is understood in a broad sense to include processes, which in truth do not amount to manufacture, the definition and the very Act would fall outside Entry 84 of List-I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The learned Judge rejected the argument holding \"at all events, even if the impost on process is not one under envy 84, List 1, but is an impost on \"processing\"\n distinct from \"manufacture\" die levy could yet be supported by entry 97, List-I even- without the aid of the wider principle recognised and adopted in Dhillon Case\". The learned Judge then referred to the principle of the decision in Union of India v, H.S. Dhillon (1971 (2) S.C.C.779) and observed: \"So far as the exclusive competence of the Union Parliament to legislate is concerned all that is necessary is to find out whether the particular topic of legislation is in List 11 or List III. if it is not, it is not necessary to go any further or search for the field in List 1. Union Parliament has exclusive power to legislate upon that topic or field. Of course, it has concurrent power also in respect of the subjects in List HI.\" \n 10.In Collector of Central Excise, Madras v. M/s. Kutty Flush Doors and Furniture Co. (P) Ltd. (1988 Suppl.S.C.C.239), this Court observed, after referring to the principle of Delhi Cloth and General Mills (supra) and South Bihar Sugar Mills (supra), to die following effect.\n  \"This principle is well-settled. This is a question of fact depending upon the relevant material whether as a result of activity, ne w and different article emerges having a distinct name, character and use. \"\n                         .LM0 11.On the meaning of expression \" process\", the following statement in the decision of this Court in Collector of Central Excise, Jaipur v. Rajasthan State Chemical Works, Deedwana, Rajasthan (1991 (4) S.C.C.473) is relevant: \"The natural meaning of the word 'process' is a mode of treatment of certain materials in order to produce a good result, a species of activity performed on the subject-matter in order to transform or reduce it to a certain stage. A to Oxford Dictionary one of the meanings of the word 'process' is \"a continuous and regular action or succession of actions taking place or carried on in a defi- nite manner and leading to the accomplishment of some result.\" The activity contemplated by the definition is perfectly general requiring only the continuous or quick succession. It is not one of the requisites that the activity should involve some operation on some material in order to its conversion to some particular stages There is nothing in the natural meanings of the word 'process' to exclude its application to handling. There may be a pro- cess which consists only in handling and there may be a process which involves no handling or not merely handling but use or also use. It may be a process involving the handling of the material and it need not be a process involving the use of material. The activity may be subordinate but one in relation to the further process of manufacture.\" 12. The question in the decision was whether the respondent was entitled to the benefit of a particular exemption notification but that question in turn raised the question what is 'manufacture' and what is 'process'? The Bench (S.\nRanganathan, Fathima Beevi and N.D. Ojha, JJ.) expressed the aforesaid opinio n.\n359 13. The decisions aforesaid make it clear that the definition of the expression 'manufacture' under Section 2(f) of the Act is not confined to the natural meaning of the expression 'manufacture' but is an expansive definition. \nCertain processes, which may not have otherwise amounted to manufacture, are also brought within the purview of and placed within the ambit of the said definition by the Parliament. Not only processes which are incidental and ancillary to the completion of manufactured product but also those processes as are specified in relation to any goods in the section or chapter notes of the schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 are also brought within the ambit of the definition. As has been repeatedly observed by the Court, though the principles enunciated are clear, it is their application that presents difficulties and it does not help to draw \"any sharp or intrinsic distinction between 'processing' and ,manufacture', \"which would only result in an oversimplification of both and tends to blur their interdependence in cases such as the present one,\" (Ujagar Points). It would also be not right, as pointed out in Ujagar Prints to try to restrict the sweep of the definition with reference to Entry 84 List-I of the seventh Schedule to the Constitution. Since the constitutionality of the said definition has been repeatedly upheld with reference to both Entries 84 and 97 of List-I (Empire Industries and Ujagar Prints), the definition must be understood in terms it is couched. It should also be remembered that the question whether a particular process does or does not amount to 'manufacture' as defined under Section 2(f) is always a question of fact to be determined in the facts of a given case applying die principles enunciated by this Court. One of the main tests evolved by this Court is whether on account of the processes employed or applied by the assessee, the commodity so obtained is no longer regarded as the original commodity but is, instead, recognised as a distinct and new article that has emerged as a result of the processes (Ujagar Prints). 14. Now coming to the facts of the case before us, it is clear from the perusal of the opinion of the third Member of the Tribunal that he has not dealt with the cast in a full and proper manner and has disposed of the issue in a cryptic manner. It has, therefore, become necessary to remit the matter for the fresh opinion of the third Member of the Tribunal. The third Member shall now hear the parties and render his opinion afresh on the question referred to him. \nHe shall do so within six months from this date. He shall transmit his opinion to this Court soon after rendering it. 15. If the third Member, Jyoti Balasundaram, who heard the matter is not available, the Chairman of die Tribunal shall specify another Member for hearing this matter. 16. List the appeal after receipt of the finding/ opinion from the Tribunal.",

Respondents\n\n                                      J U D G M E N T \n INDU MALHOTRA, J. \n 1. The present Criminal Appeal has been filed by the State of Madhya Pradesh against the judgment and order dated 03.01.2006 passed by the Gwalior Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, in Criminal Appeal No. 657/1998. The Criminal Appeal was filed by the Respondents against their conviction under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as \"Section 307\"). The High Court reduced the conviction of the Respondents from Section 307 to Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as \"Section 324\"). 2. The facts of the case, briefly stated, are as under: 2.1 The case of the Complainant  Sukhdev, as recorded in the F.I.R., is that on 12.11.1997 the ComplainantSukhdev along with his brothers  Balveer Yadav and Deshraj Yadav, had gone to the District Court, Ashok Nagar to attend the hearing of their case against Accused /Respondent No. 1  Harjeet Singh. After the hearing, at around noon, the Complainant  Sukhdev and his brothers crossed the road, and were standing in front of the Jail, when Ramji Lal Accused /Respondent No. 2 alongwith an unidentified assailant called Sardar caught hold of Balveer Yadav and Deshraj Yadav. The Accused /Respondent No. 1  Harjeet Singh grabbed the Complainant  Sukhdev, and stabbed him several times with a knife, inflicting blows on the chest, scapula, back, and hips. \n Accused /Respondent Nos. 1 and 2, alongwith Sardar ran away from the spot. The Complainant Sukhdev further stated that he would be able to identify Harjeet Singh, and the two assailants once he sees them. \n2.2 Immediately after the assault on 12.11.1997, the Complainant  Sukhdev was admitted to the Civil Hospital, Ashok Nagar for treatment. \n2.3 The medical examination of the Complainant  Sukhdev was conducted by Dr. M. Bhagat  P.W.6 at the Civil Hospital, Ashok Nagar, which recorded the following injuries : (i) Stab Wound  3.5 x 1 cm  deep in the chest cavity, over the left side of the chest.\n        (ii) Spindle shaped incised wound  3 x 2 cm  muscle deep, present on the upper region of the right buttocks. \n        (iii) Stab Wound  2 x 1 cm  over subscapula region, left side. Bleeding was present. \n        (iv) Stab Wound  1 x 1 cm  over illeal region of hip, left side. Bleeding was present. \n The medical report further stated that the injuries were caused by a sharpedged, pointed object. \n 2.4 The Complainant   Sukhdev was referred to the District Hospital, Guna wherein XRay of his chest region was conducted by P.W. 8  Dr.\n       Raghuvanshi. The Report states that there was \"haziness in lungs, left side of chest, present due to trauma of chest\".\n                Dr. Raghuvanshi  P.W. 8 stated in his deposition that the lungs of the Complainant  Sukhdev suffered injury, which resulted in blood seeping in the lungs, leading to haziness in the X Ray image. \n 2.5 On 24.11.1997, the Accused /Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were arrested by the Police. The weapon of offence i.e. the knife allegedly used by Accused /Respondent No. 1 was recovered from the bushes next to the bridge, on the statement given by Accused /Respondent No. 1.\n 2.6 The Spot Map of the crime scene was prepared, samples of bloodstained soil, and ordinary soil, were recovered from the scene of the crime. \n 2.7 The Accused /Respondent No. 1 was charged under Section 307, while Accused /Respondent No. 2 was charged under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the I.P.C. \n 2.8 The case was registered as Case No. 10/98 before the First Addl. Sessions Judge, Ashok Nagar, Guna District, Madhya Pradesh (Sessions Court). \n 2.9 The Sessions Court vide Judgment dated 30.11.1998, found Accused /Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 guilty of the offence of `attempt to murder'. The findings of the Sessions Court were as follows: i. The Complainant  Sukhdev, and his brothers Deshraj Yadav and Balveer Yadav who were eyewitnesses of the crime, and were present at the scene of occurrence, and were examined by the Court as P.W.s 2, 4, and 5 respectively. \n           Their evidence was held to be reliable, and was corroborated by the examination of P.W. 3  an independent witness who was an Advocate. \n P.W. 3 appeared before the Court, and deposed that on 12.11.1997 he heard a commotion outside the Court. On reaching the spot, he found the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) lying in a pool of blood. On further inquiry, he was told that the Accused /Respondent No. 1  Harjeet Singh had stabbed the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) multiple times. ii. The medical evidence was held to be sufficient to prove that the injuries inflicted by Accused /Respondent No. 1 upon the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) could be fatal. iii. With respect to Accused /Respondent No. 2  Ramji Lal, the F.I.R. stated that the Accused /Respondent No. 2 along with an unidentified Sardar held the brothers of the Complainant (P.W.s 4 and 5), while the Accused /Respondent No. 1 stabbed the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) multiple times. iv. During the trial, the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) deposed that Accused /Respondent No. 2  Ramji Lal grabbed him when Accused /Respondent No. 1  Harjeet Singh stabbed him multiple times. v. The Sessions Court held the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. \n It was held that the Accused /Respondent No. 2 would be equally guilty. The common intention of Accused /Respondent No. 2 was proved by the assistance provided by him to Accused /Respondent No. 1, in committing the offence. \n            vi. The Sessions Court convicted the Accused /Respondent No. 1 under Section 307, sentencing him to 5 years R.I. along with a Fine of Rs. 1000/.\n  Accused /Respondent No. 2 was convicted under Section 307 read with Section 34 I.P.C.\n                   and sentenced to 5 years R.I. along with a fine of Rs. 1000/. \n2.10 Both the Accused /Respondents filed a common appeal to challenge their conviction by the judgment dated 30.11.1998 before the Madhya Pradesh High Court being Criminal Appeal No. 657/1998. \n2.11 The Madhya Pradesh High Court vide Impugned Judgment dated 03.01.2006 partly allowed the Appeal filed by the Accused /Respondents. It was held that the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) had nowhere stated in his deposition/evidence that the intention of the Accused /Respondents was to commit murder. The High Court held that the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) suffered four injuries. One of the injuries was on the left side of the chest. The depth of this injury was upto the cavity over the left side of the chest, but the lung was not affected. The other three injuries sustained by the Complainant  Sukhdev, are on the back, and the hips. The Accused /Respondents having an intention to commit murder would never cause injuries over such \"unimportant\" parts of the body. \n It was also noted that the knife by which the injuries were allegedly inflicted had a blade of five fingers which could not be more than four inches. \n With regard to the liability of the Accused /Respondent No. 2  Ramji Lal, the High Court held that there appears to be lack of consistency in the statements of the Complainant  Sukhdev and his two brothers who were eyewitnesses : a. The first version of the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) which has been written in the Dehati Nalsi, is that the Accused /Respondent No. 2  Ramji Lal, and one unknown Sardar both caught hold of his two brothers. It is not mentioned in this document that Accused /Respondent No. 2   Ramji Lal or the other unknown Sardar, caught hold of him at the time of the incident. Conversely, in paragraph 2 of his statement, the Complainant  Sukhdev has stated that he was held by Accused /Respondent No. 2  Ramji Lal at the time of the incident, and in paragraph 5 he has stated that after sustaining the injuries of the knife, Accused /Respondent No. 2 caught hold of his brother Deshraj (P.W. 4). \n b. On the other hand, Deshraj Yadav (P.W. 4)  the first brother of the Complainant  Sukhdev, has stated that he was being held by one unknown Sardar and not by Accused /Respondent No. 2. \n c. Balveer Yadav (P.W. 5)  the second brother of the Complainant  Sukhdev, has stated that he was being held by Accused /Respondent No. 2  Ramji Lal and his brother was held by one unknown Sardar. \n        The High Court found that there was no consistency in the deposition of P.Ws 2, 4, and 5 read with the F.I.R. Considering these circumstances, it was held that there could be no presumption that Accused /Respondent No. 2  Ramji Lal had committed any act having a common intention with the Accused /Respondent No. 1  Harjeet Singh, in causing the injuries to the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2). \n The mere fact that Accused /Respondent No. 2 had accompanied Accused /Respondent No.\n1 cannot raise the presumption of having common intention.\n  It was further held that it was not justifiable to conclude that the Accused /Respondents had any intention to commit murder, or cause such injury which could have been deemed as sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. At most, the act of causing the injuries could be held punishable under Section 324, I.P.C. as punishment for voluntarily causing simple hurt. The High Court converted the conviction of Accused /Respondent No. 1 from Section 307 to Section 324 I.P.C. and reduced the sentence to one year R.I. and a Fine of Rs. 1,000. The period already undergone would be adjusted in the sentence awarded to him. Accused /Respondent No. 2 was acquitted and his conviction from the charge of Section 307 was setaside. \n3. The State filed the present Special Leave Petition, against the Judgment and Order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court dated 03.01.2006. Special leave to appeal was granted vide Order dated 08.07.2009. 4. We have heard learned Counsel for both the parties, considered the submissions, and perused the evidence record. 5. FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS 5.1 In the present case, a perusal of the facts and the record clearly indicate that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that Accused /Respondent No. 1  Harjeet Singh had inflicted four injuries, on the Complainant by using a knife. The oral testimonies of Deshraj Yadav (P.W.\n       4) and Balveer Yadav (P.W. 5)  the brothers of the Complainant  Sukhdev who were eye witnesses, stood corroborated by the medical evidence.\n5.2 The prosecution also examined an independent witness  Advocate (P.W. 3), who had come to the Court, and after hearing the commotion, reached the site of occurrence, where he found the Complainant  Sukhdev lying in a pool of blood along with his brothers  P.W.s 4 and 5. The independent witness  Advocate (P.W. 3) deposed that on enquiring further about the matter, he was informed by P.W.s 4 and 5  the brothers of the complainant  Sukhdev, that Accused /Respondent No. 1  Harjeet Singh had attacked and stabbed the Complainant.\n 5.3 Dr. Raghuvanshi  the Radiologist (P.W. 8) has stated in his deposition that the injury caused to the Complainant  Sukhdev in the chest had resulted in blood seeping into the lungs. The Medical Report records that the first stab wound was inflicted on the chest of the Complainant, which injured his lung, and caused bleeding. \n       Hence, the finding of the High Court that the stab wound on the chest remained upto the depth of the cavity over left side of the chest and the lungs were not affected, is factually incorrect, and contrary to the medical record. 5.4 The Accused /Respondent No. 1 inflicted other stab wounds on the scapula, which were bleeding even at the time when the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) was examined at the Hospital. \n       There was also a stab wound present on the upper region of the right buttock, and another one over the illeal region of the left hip which was bleeding at the time of the medical examination. \n The injuries inflicted on the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) have been corroborated by the medical evidence on the basis of the medical reports and the depositions of Dr. Bhagat (P.W. 6) and Dr. Raghuvanshi (P.W. 8).\n Dr. Raghuvanshi (P.W. 8) has stated that the blood seeping in the left lung of the Complainant  Sukhdev (P.W. 2) , was due to the injury sustained on the chest . Such an injury could not be considered to be an injury on an \"unimportant part\" of the body. \n The findings of the High Court that the injuries inflicted were on \"unimportant parts\" of the Complainant's body, is erroneous. \n5.5 The act of stabbing a person with a sharp knife, which is a dangerous weapon, near his vital organs, would ordinarily lead to the death of the victim. \n The weapon of offence was a 4inch long knife which is a dangerous weapon. The Accused /Respondent No. 1 had assaulted the Complainant with the said knife, and inflicted multiple injuries on his chest, scapula, back, and buttocks. The multiple blows inflicted by the Accused /Respondent No. 1 would prove the intention of causing bodily injury likely to cause the death of the victim. Stabbing a person with a knife, near his vital organs would in most circumstances lead to the death of the victim, thereby falling squarely within the meaning of Section 307. \n               5.6 Section 307 uses the term \"hurt\" which has been explained in Section 319, I.P.C.; and not \"grievous hurt\" within the meaning of Section 320 I.P.C.\n                               If a person causes hurt with the intention or knowledge that he may cause death, it would attract Section 307. This Court in R. Prakash v. State of Karnataka,1 held that : \"...The first blow was on a vital part, that is on the temporal region. Even though other blows were on nonvital parts, that does not take away the rigor of Section 307 IPC....... It is sufficient to justify a conviction under Section 307 if there is present 1 (2004) 9 SCC 27 an intent coupled with some overt act in execution thereof. It is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted. \n                           Although the nature of injury actually caused may often give considerable assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be deduced from other circumstances, and may even, in some cases, be ascertained without any reference at all to actual wounds.\n                            The Sections makes a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any. The Court has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the Section.\"\n (emphasis supplied) If the assailant acts with the intention or knowledge that such action might cause death, and hurt is caused, then the provisions of Section 307 I.P.C. would be applicable. There is no requirement for the injury to be on a \"vital part\"\n of the body, merely causing `hurt' is sufficient to attract S. 307 I.P.C .2 This Court in Jage Ram v. State of Haryana3 held that: \"12. For the purpose of conviction under Section 307 IPC, prosecution 2 State of Madhya Pradesh v. Mohan & Ors, (2013) 14 SCC 116 3 (2015) 11 SCC 366 has to establish (i) the intention to commit murder and (ii) the act done by the accused. The burden is on the prosecution that accused had attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution witness. Whether the accused person intended to commit murder of another person would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. To justify a conviction under Section 307 IPC, it is not essential that fatal injury capable of causing death should have been caused. Although the nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be adduced from other circumstances. The intention of the accused is to be gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the weapon used, words used by the accused at the time of the incident, motive of the accused, parts of the body where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and severity of the blows given etc.\" \n (emphasis supplied) This Court in the recent decision of State of M.P. v. Kanha @ Omprakash4 held that: \"The above judgements of this Court lead us to the conclusion that proof of grievous or lifethreatening hurt is not a sine qua non for the offence under Section 307 of the Penal Code. The intention of the accused can be ascertained from the actual injury, if any, as well as from surrounding circumstances. Among other things, the nature of the weapon used and the 4 Criminal Appeal No. 1589/2018, decided on 04.02.2019. \n severity of the blows inflicted can be considered to infer intent.\"\n (emphasis supplied) 5.7 In view of the abovementioned findings, it is evident that the ingredients of Section 307 have been made out, as the intention of the Accused /Respondent No. 1 can be ascertained clearly from his conduct, and the circumstances surrounding the offence. \n 5.8 In the Impugned Judgment, the High Court incorrectly held that the Prosecution has been unable to prove that the Accused /Respondent No. 1 had the intention to commit murder of the Complainant. The motive of assault by the Accused /Respondent No. 1 on the Complainant Sukhdev (P.W. 2) was clearly established by the Prosecution, since there was an existing dispute which was the subject matter of a court case. \n 5.9 It is evident from the evidence adduced before the Court, and the circumstances surrounding the case, that the prosecution has been able to prove the case against Accused /Respondent No. 1 beyond reasonable doubt. We find that the prosecution has successfully proved that the Accused /Respondent No. 1  Harjeet Singh had attempted to murder the Complainant  Sukhdeo and the requirements of Section 307 are made out from the ocular evidence which are corroborated by the medical evidence. \n           5.10 In view of the abovementioned discussion, the High Court was in error in reducing the sentence of Accused /Respondent No. 1  Harjeet Singh from Section 307 I.P.C. to Section 324 I.P.C., and sentencing him to 1 year R.I. along with Fine of Rs. 1,000. \n6. The present Criminal Appeal is partially allowed. The judgment of the High Court qua Accused /Respondent No. 1, is setaside, and the sentence awarded to him by the Sessions Judge vide Judgment dated 30.11.1998 is restored. The Accused /Respondent No. 1 is directed to undergo the remainder of the 5 year Sentence awarded by the Sessions Court, and surrender before the Sessions Court, Ashok Nagar, Guna, M.P. within 2 weeks from the date of this Judgment. \n 7. In so far as the case against Accused /Respondent No. 2 Ramji Lal is concerned; the prosecution has not been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the charge under Section 307 r. w. Section 34 I.P.C. The High Court has rightly held that there is lack of consistency in the deposition of the Prosecution witnesses with respect to the role of the Accused /Respondent No. 2  Ramji Lal.\n                  We affirm the judgment of the High Court qua Accused No. 2, and confirm the Order of acquittal passed in his favour on 03.01.2006.\n                    The Criminal Appeal along with all pending Applications, if any, are disposed of in the above terms. Ordered accordingly. ...............................J.\n                                                           (L.

Various charges were framed against\nthe six accused, including those of murder and rioting. The\nTrial Judge acquitted three of the accused persons,\nconvicted two under S. 302 I.P.C. and one under S. 324.\n\n          Cross-appeals were preferred in the High Court; one by\nthe three accused against their convictions, and another by\nthe State, against the acquittals. The High Court convicted\nall the six accused of the offence of rioting. A-2 to A-6\nunder S. 302 read with S. 34, A-1 under Ss. 302/149 and\n302/109, and A-2 under S. 324. It was contended before this\nCourt that on the facts of the case, the High Court was not\njustified in interfering with the acquittal of A-1. A-5 and\nA-6, and that A-2 who did not physically participate in the\nfatal beating of the deceased, could not be held vicariously\nliable for the acts of others, and that S. 34 was not\napplicable to him.\n\n          Partly allowing the appeals, the Court\n^\n\n         HELD: (1) In the case of an offence involving physical\nviolence, it is essential for the application of S. 34 that\nthe person who instigates or aids the commission of the\ncrime must be physically present at the actual commission of\nthe crime for the purpose of facilitating or promoting the\noffence, the commission of which is the aim of the joint\ncriminal venture. [881 C-D ]\n\n         (2) The \"act\" spoken of in S. 34 includes a series of\nacts as a single act. It follows that the words \"when a\ncriminal act is done by several persons\" in S. 34, may be\nconstrued to mean \"when criminal acts are done by several\npersons\". The acts committed by different confederates in\nthe criminal action may be different but all must in one way\nor the other participate and engage in the criminal\nenterprise. Such presence of those who in one way or the\n\nother facilitate the execution of the common design, is\nitself tantamount to actual participation in the 'criminal\nact'. [881 A-B & D]\n\n         (3) The essence of S. 34 is simultaneous consensus of\nthe minds of persons participating in the 'criminal action'\nto bring about a particular result. Such consensus can be\n developed at the spot and thereby intended by all of them. \n[881 D-E ]\n\nJUDGMENT:          CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No.\n 251 of 1972 and 243 of 1973.\n         Appeals by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 22-9-72 of the Madras High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 369/72 and 976/71. \n Debaratea Mookerjee, M. S. K. Sastri and M. S.\nNarasimhan for the Appellants. \n A. V. Rangam and Miss A. Subhashni, for the Respondents. 877 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by UNTWALIA, J.  Criminal Appeal No. 251 of 1972 has been filed under section 2 of the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970 and Criminal Appeal No. 243 of 1973 is by special leave. In all there are six appellants. It would be convenient to refer to them with reference to their accused number given in the judgment of the Sessions Court. They are as follows: Accused No. 1 (A-1)-Ramaswami Ayyangar.\n                  Accused No. 2 (A-2)-Vattappan.\n                  Accused No. 3 (A-3)-Kaipillai alias Karuppayyan.\n                   Accused No. 4 (A-4)-Raman. \n                  Accused No. 5 (A-5)-Kathayyan.\n                  Accused No. 6 (A-6)-Kulandaiyan. \n         The occurrence giving rise to these two appeals took place on Monday the 21st April, 1971 at about 4.00 p.m. at Sivan Koil tank in village Thaduthalkondapuram. In the said occurrence was seriously injured one Kaliaperumal who later died in the Hospital at about 9.00 p.m. the same evening. Another person injured in the occurrence was also named Kaliaperumal, P.W. 1. The prosecution case is that deceased Kaliaperumal was living with his maternal uncle Pichai Konar, P.W. 7 since infancy. A-1 is the Karnam of the village and A-6 is the Government vetti. A-2 and A-3 are brothers, A-4, A-5 and A-6 are also inter-se brothers. A-2 to A-6 worked under A-1. There was enmity between P.W. 7 and the deceased on the one hand and A-1 on the other on account of several causes. The facts showing the enmity between them are stated in the judgments of the courts below and are not necessary to be detailed here. Two days prior to the occurrence Marimuthu, P.W. 10 was driving some cattle, 4 or 5 of them went astray and entered into the Gingillillai (field) belonging to A-1. A-1's men scolded P.W. 10 and the deceased who was informed about the incident by the former at a tea shop. P.W. 1 was also present there. Deceased Kaliaperumal passed on the information to P.W. 7.\n         Ramalingam, P.W. 4 brother of the deceased was taking his bath in the Sivan Koil tank. Kaliaperumal (deceased) also came there saying something against the Karnam. He also started bathing at the north-western corner of the tank. According to the prosecution case, A-1 came there followed by A-2 to A-6. A-2 had a cross-stop (an instrument used in Survey and measurement, perhaps the correct name of the instrument is cross-staff). A-3 and A-4 were each armed with an Aruval. A-5 had a stick and A-6 was carrying a stick with a spear attached to it. According to the evidence in Court, A-1 told the other accused \"Not content to with grazing (his) cattle in my gingilly field, he is also abusing me. \nCut him, whatever be the expenses, I will look after that.\" \nThereupon A-4 asked the deceased Kaliaperumal \"Why are you abusing the 'Iyer' ?\" Saying something Kaliaperumal ascended the bank. A-3 and A-4 assaulted him on his head with Aruvals. P.W. 1 ran to separate them when A-2 assaulted him on 878 his head with the cross-stop. P.W. 1 attempted to run. \nThereupon it is said A-6 obstructed him from running with the help of the stick with spear head. A-4 again cut on the head of Kallaperumal (deceased) with his Aruval. A-2 beat on P.W's head with the cross-stop hour or five times. P.W. 1 fell down unconscious. P.W. 7 and others took the injured to the Government Dispensary Kodavasal. Dr. Radha Singh, Civil Assistant Surgeon, P.W. 15 examined Kallaperumal deceased at 4.55 p.m. and issued a Wound Certificate. Since his condition was serious he was sent to the Government Hospital, Kumbakonam. P.W.15 examined the injuries or P.W. 1 at 5.20 p.m. and found as many as nine injuries on his person. As already stated Kaliaperumal died at about 9.00 p.m. Dr. N. Jayaraj, P.W. 18 performed the autopsy over the dead body. As many as 14 injuries were found. The injuries given on the head with Aruval according to the opinions of the Doctors were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause his death. \n Various charges were framed against the six accused including that of rioting under section 147 IPC against A-1 and A-5 and section 148 against A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-6. A-1 was further charged under sections 302/149 and sections 302/109. A-2 to A-6 were charged under section 302. An extra charge under section 324 was levelled against A-2 for causing simple hurt to P.W. 1 with the cross-stop, an instrument which had sharp edges. A-6 was also charged under section 341 of the Penal Code for preventing P.W. 1 from escaping. The accused denied their complicity in the occurrence and pleaded not guilty. A-1 took a plea of alibi also and asserted that he had gone to Madras in connection with some marriage negotiations. Two days after the date of occurrence he was arrested at Kumbakonam Railway Station when he alighted from the train on his return from Madras. The Trial Judge acquitted A-1, A-5 and A-6 of all the charges. He convicted A-3 and A-4 under section 302 of the Penal Code and awarded a sentence of life imprisonment to each of them. They were acquitted of the charge under section 148. A-2 was convicted only under section 324 with a sentence of 4 months' rigorous imprisonment and acquitted of all other charges. A-2, A-3 and A-4 preferred an appeal in the Madras High Court against their conviction and the sentences imposed upon them by the Trial Court. State preferred an appeal against the acquittals of A-1, A-5 and A-6 as also against the acquittal of A-2 of the charge under section 302. It, however, did not prefer any appeal against the acquittal of A-2, A-3 and A-4 of the charge under section 148 of the Penal Code. Yet it is surprising to find that the High Court has convicted all the six accused for the offences of rioting, A-1 and A-5 under section 147 with two years' rigorous imprisonment and A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-6 under section 148 with 3 years' rigorous imprisonment. Conviction of A-3 and A-4 for the offence of murder under section 302 has been maintained with the aid of section 34. High Court has also convicted A-2, A-5 and A-6 under sections 302/34 and awarded each of them life imprisonment. A-1 has been convicted by the High Court under sections 302/149 and 302/109 with sentence 879 of life imprisonment under each. Conviction of A-2 under section 324 has been maintained. Hence these two appeals. \n That there was enmity and bad blood between A-1 and P.W. 7 is not open to any doubt. An occurrence did take place on the date, time and place as given by the prosecution. The manner of occurrence in so far as it relates to the attack on the deceased is concerned by A-2 and A-3 has also been proved to the hilt. The factum of assault by A-2 on P.W. 1 also does not admit of any doubt. \nBut the High Court does not seem to be justified in reversing the order of acquittal recorded by the Trial Court in favour of A-1, A-5 and A-6.\n  It was claimed by the prosecution that apart from P.W.\n1 there were four more eye witnesses to the occurrence namely Govindaswami, P.W. 3, Ramalingam, P.W. 4, Rajagopal, P.W. 5, and Kaliaperumal, P.W. 6. P.Ws 3 and 4 are brothers of the deceased. P.W. 5 is the brother-in-law of P.W. 3. \nExt. P-1 is the statement of P.W. 1 before the police on the basis of which the First Information Report was drawn up. On reading this statement as also the evidence of P.W. 1 in Court, the Trial Judge rightly came to the conclusion that P.Ws. 3, 4, 5 and 6 arrived at the scene of occurrence after it had taken place. None of them had witnessed it. It considered the evidence of each witness, viz. P.Ws. 3 to 6, individually and did not rely upon it. In our judgment, the High Court was not right as against the explicit statement and evidence of P.W. 1 in reading P.Ws. 3 to 6 as eye witnesses to the occurrence. It is significant to note that although P.Ws. 3 and 4 were the brothers of the deceased Kaliaperumal but none of them made any attempt to save him form the attack of the assailants. Had they been present at the occurrence surely they would have tried to save their brother, as was done by P.W. 1. We are, therefore, left with the evidence of P.W. 1 alone. Since he was injured in the same occurrence, undoubtedly, his ocular version of the incident is of great value to the prosecution. \n The plea of alibi set up by A-1 has not been substantiated at all. The Trial Judge was not right in doubting the prosecution case merely because A-1 had applied for leave on the 18th April-3 days before the occurrence. \nThere was no evidence to show that he was at Madras on the date of occurrence. According to the Investigating Agency, A-1 was arrested not on the Railway platform but near the Railway level crossing of Kumbakonam Railway Station. But the Trial Court was right in saying that the only part attributed to A-1 was the order giving for assault. In the statement Ext. P-1 the only words of order attributed to A-1 are \"to cut\". In court there was great embellishment and improvement in the evidence of P.W. 1 when he put several sentences in the mouth of A-1 at the time of the alleged order-giving. As already stated, A-1 was the Karnam of the village and even if he was at the back of the assault on the deceased it does not stand to reason that he himself would go to the place of occurrence merely for giving the order for assault. The order, if any, must have been given to the assailants in secret by A-1. He must not have come to the place of occurrence merely for this purpose. We 880 are, therefore, of the view that although the High Court in its judgment purported to keep in front the well-settled principles of law to justify an interference by it with the order of acquittal, it did commit a mistake in the applications of those principles. Conviction of A-1 by the High Court under any count is not justified. \n So do we find in the case of A-5 and A-6 that they had not taken any part in the occurrence at all. The alleged obstruction given by A-6 to P.W. 1 when he wanted to run was not believable and has not been believed by the Trial Court. \nThe reasons given by the Trial Court for their acquittal were not such as to justify an interference by the High Court. The view taken by the Trial Court was reasonably possible to be taken. Coming to the case of A-2 we find that he did assault P.W. 1 with the cross-staff marked Ext. MO-1. This cross- staff, as alleged, has been recovered from the house of A-1. \nThe Trial Court, rightly, did not believe the story of its recovery from his house. But surely A-2 had used the cross- staff for assaulting P.W. 1. A serious question for consideration is whether his conviction under section 302 with the aid of section 34 is justified or not. In this connection we find the statement of P.W. 1 in Ext. P-1 to the following effect: \"Raman too with the aruval in his hand dealt a cut at the front portion of his head. I ran there to prevent it. At that time Vattappan with the string fixed wood he was having in his hand beat on my head.\" \nIn the Sessions Court also he deposed: \"Thereupon, Accused No. 3 immediately cut on the head of Kaliyaperumal in the front portion with the aruval he was having in his hand. I ran to separate them. Immediately Accused No. 2 beat on my head with M.O. 1..... \n         Then accused number 2 beat on my head with M.O. 1, 4 or 5 times. I fell down unconscious. After some time, President Kaliyaperumal, Rajagopal, Mani alias Rajagopal, Ramalingam, Govindaswami-these persons came there. \nFrom the evidence of P.W. 1 corroborated as it is from his statement in Ext. P-1 it is clear that P.W. 1 wanted to save Kaliyaperumal- the deceased, from the murderous attack by A- 3 and A-4. A-2 was standing as a guard and did not allow P.W. 1 to protect the deceased. A-2 went to the length of assaulting P.W. 1 and making him fall down unconscious. \n         It is contended that A-2 cannot be held vicariously liable with the aid of s. 34 for the act of A-3 and A-4, for two reasons: Firstly, he did not physically participate in the fatal beating administered by A-3 and A-4 to the deceased and thus the \"criminal act\" of murder was not done by all these three accused within the contemplation of s.\n34, the act committed by A-2 in regard to the beating of P.W. 1 being a different and separate act of A-2. Secondly, it has not been shown that the act of A-2 in beating P.W. 1 was committed in 881 furtherance of the common intention of all the three, pursuant to a pre-arranged plan. \n         The contention is fallacious and cannot be accepted. \nSection 34 is to be read along with the preceding s. 33 which makes it clear that the \"act\" spoken of in s. 34 includes a series of acts as a single act. It follows that the words \"when a criminal act is done by several persons\"\nin s. 34, may be construed to mean \"when criminal acts are done by several persons\". The acts committed by different confederates in the criminal action may be different but all must in one way or the other participate and engage in the criminal enterprise, for instance, one may only stand guard to prevent any person coming to the relief of the victim or to otherwise facilitate the execution of the common design. \n Such a person also commits an \"act\" as much as his co- participants actually committing the planned crime. In the case of an offence involving physical violence, however, it is essential for the application of s. 34 that the person who instigates or aids the commission of the crime must be physically present at the actual commission of the crime for the purpose of facilitating or promoting the offence, the commission of which is the aim of the joint criminal venture. Such presence of those who in one way or the other facilitate the execution of the common, design, is itself tantamount to actual participation in the 'criminal act'. The essence of s. 34 is simultaneous consensus of the minds of persons participating in the criminal action to bring about a particular result. Such consensus can be developed at the spot and thereby intended by all of them. In the case before us, A-2 obviously, was acting in concert with A-3 and A-4 in causing the murder of the deceased, when he prevented PW 1 from going to the relief of the deceased. Section 34 was therefore fully attracted and under the circumstances A- 2 was equally responsible for the murder of the deceased. \n Under these circumstances we think the High Court was justified in convicting A-2 for the offence of murder of Kaliyaperumal with the aid of section 34 of the Penal Code. \n There was absolutely no difficulty in maintaining the convictions of A-3 and A-4 for the murder of Kaliyaperumal with the aid of section 34 because both had mercilessly assaulted him with Aruvals on the vital parts of the body. \n In the case of A-2 also it is quite legitimate to hold that he had shared the common intention of A-3 and A-4 in the commission of the murder of Kaliyaperumal. \n The conviction of none of the accused for the offence of rioting can be maintained either in law or on facts. In the view which we have expressed above that the High Court was not justified in reversing the acquittals of A-1, A-5 and A-6, there were only 3 left in the party of the assailants. Moreover the State did not file any appeal, as 882 stated already, against the acquittal of A-2, A-3 and A-4 under section 148 of the Penal Code. That being so, they could not be convicted for having formed an unlawful assembly for any criminal common object. None could be convicted, therefore, under sections 147 or 148. Section 149 could not be pressed into service against any. \n In the result we allow both the appeals in part, restore the order of acquittal recorded in favour of A-1 viz., Ramaswami Ayyangar, A-5 Kathayyan and A-6 Kulandaiyan acquitting them of all the charges, set aside the conviction of the remaining accused under sections 147 and 148 of the Penal Code and maintain the convictions of A-2 Vattappan, A- 3 Kaipillai alias Karuppayyan, A-4 Raman under section 302/34 with the sentence of life imprisonment to each. We also maintain the conviction of A-2 under section 324 Indian Penal Code with the concurrent sentence of 4 months' rigorous imprisonment under the said count. \n M.R.                 Appeals partly allowed.",

This appeal has been preferred by the assessee under Section 260-A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act', for short) which was admitted by a Bench of this Court by an order dated 20.04.2010 on the following substantial questions of law:  a) Whether in law, the Tribunal is justified in ignoring the fact that the expenditure on borrowals was a business expenditure in as much as the same had been incurred during the course and for the purpose of business of the Appellant?\nb) Whether in law, the Tribunal is justified in rejecting the claim under Section 36(1)(iii) of the Appellant towards the payment of interest on borrowing when the genuineness of such borrowings and the utilization of such amounts in the business is not disputed?\nc) Whether in law, the Tribunal is justified in confirming the orders of the lower authorities holding that the Appellant had restored to an artificial arrangement to reduce its profit and in turn also make its sister concern eligible for more deduction under Section 80 HHC of the Act on mere surmise and conjectures?\nd) Whether in law, the Tribunal is justified in rejecting the claim of the Appellant made towards the payment of interest on borrowings and discounting on LCs when the Appellant had fulfilled all the conditions laid down under the provisions of Section 36(1)(iii) Section 37 of the Act to claim the same as its business expenditure? 3. Facts giving rise to the filing of the appeal briefly stated are that the appellant is a registered firm engaged in the business of manufacture of resins and chemicals with the help of credit purchases bearing interest and largely selling its finished products to its sister concern namely M/s. Canara Wood and Plywood Pvt. Ltd., Mangalore for the assessment year 1997-98, the appellant filed the return of income on 25.09.1997 declaring an income of `4,47,710/-. The Assessing Authority, by an order dated 31.03.2000 made an order of assessment disallowing the interest expenditure claimed by the appellant on the ground that the appellant had deliberately adopted artificial and colourable device for reducing the income and tax thereon through arrangement of letter of credit discounting in respect of sale bills raised in the name of the sister concern M/s. Canara Wood and Plywood Pvt.\nLtd. Being aggrieved, the appellant preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) which was dismissed by an order dated 30.03.2009. The Appellate Authority, inter alia, held that the letter of credit was obtained allowing the sister concern to enjoy higher income which was subjected to deduction under Section 80HHC of the Act. Being aggrieved, the petitioner preferred an appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The order passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) has been upheld by the Tribunal. In the aforesaid factual background, this appeal has been filed. \n 4. Learned counsel for the appellant, while inviting the attention of this Court to Section 36(1)(iii) of the Act, submitted that in order to attract the applicability of the aforesaid provision, three conditions are required to be satisfied namely that the money must have been borrowed by the assessee, it must have been borrowed for the purpose of business and the assessee must have paid the interest on the aforesaid amount. It is further submitted that in case such conditions are complied with, the appellant is entitled to the benefit under Section 36(1)(iii) of the Act. It is further submitted that the Assessing Officer, the Appellate Authority as well as the Tribunal ought to have appreciated that the appellant had satisfied the aforesaid requirement and therefore, the appellant was entitled to the benefit contained in Section 36(1)(iii) of the Act. Learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that the appellant had obtained loan on account of business expediency and had paid interest on the amount of loan. \nHowever, the aforesaid aspect has not been appreciated. \nIn support of the aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decisions in the case of `COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX Vs. BOMBAY SAMACHAR LTD.' (1969) 74 ITR 0723, `S.A.BUILDERS LTD. Vs. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX (APPEALS) & ANR.' (2007) 288 ITR 0001, `HOTEL ROOPA Vs. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX' (2015) 231 TAXMAN 0425 (KARNATAKA), `ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX Vs. MICRO LABS LTD.' (2016) 380 ITR 0001 (SC) AND `THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX Vs. M/s. SHRIRAM INVESTMENTS' IN TCA NO.166/2019 DATED 21.02.2019. \n 5. On the other hand, learned counsel for the revenue has taken us through the order of assessment, order passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) as well as the order passed by the Tribunal and has submitted that cogent reasons have been assigned by the Tribunal for disallowing the benefit to the appellant as claimed by it. It is also submitted that infact the substantial questions of law framed by this Court do not arise for consideration in this appeal. \n 6. We have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record. From perusal of Section 36(1)(iii) of the Act, it is evident that 3 conditions have to be complied with namely, money must have been borrowed by the assessee, it must have been borrowed for the purpose of business and the assessee must have paid the interest on the aforesaid amount and claimed it as deduction. \nHowever, in the instant case, the Assessing Authority, by an order dated 31.03.2000 has held that the assessee mainly supplies its finished products to its sister concern namely M/s. Canara Wood and Plywood Pvt. Ltd. Mangalore, which is engaged in the manufacturing of plywood, boards, etc. and exports to foreign countries as well as enjoys the benefit of deduction under Section 80HHC of the Act. On perusal of the books of accounts, it has been held that against the supply of finished products, the assessee firm does not directly collect the sale proceeds from the sister concern. Instead of using the sale bill pertaining to sister concern, the assessee has availed of the letter of credit discounting with the banks and has availed of the loan and has paid interest on the bank credit. The aforesaid borrowed loans are used to make payments towards interest bearing credit on the credit balance of the raw material suppliers etc. The Assessing Officer has, however, recorded that the assessee is made to bear the interest burden of sister concern namely M/s.\nCanara Wood and Plywood Pvt. Ltd. which is a private limited company enjoying the benefit of 80HHC of the Act and thus, the profit of the assessee is artificially reduced and inturn the income offered for taxation is decreased. It has further been held that this artificial arrangement has been made to reduce the interest burden on the sister concern. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) has upheld the aforesaid finding and has held that the assessee has tried to give the whole arrangement a colour of business expediency falling within the purpose and nexus to business. But on a close scrutiny, it is evident that it is nothing but shouldering the interest burden on itself, thereby diverting the benefit in favour of the sister concern. It has further been held that where the borrowing is illusory or colourable, the interest paid on such borrowings is not allowable. Reference has been made to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of `MC DWELL & CO. LTD. VS. COMMERCIAL TAX OFFICER' (1985) 154 ITR 148. The Tribunal, by the impugned order, in paragraph 6.2 has held that the assessee firm has supplied its finished products to its sister concern for which it has not insisted for the sale proceeds and has availed letter of credit against the bills and paid interest. This arrangement, by no stretch of imagination, can be considered as business prudence and expediency. It has further been held that no prudent businessman pays interest on the payment to his creditors and at the same time does not charge corresponding interest on the delayed payment from its debtor. It has further been held that the aforesaid arrangement has been made with an object to circumvent the provisions of the Act to facilitate its sister concern to rest on the shoulders of the appellant. It has also been held that the appellant has deliberately created an artificial and colourable devise for reducing its income offered for taxation through an arrangement of letter of credit and thus, the deduction claimed by the assessee on account of interest paid to the bank and also to its creditors are not allowable. \n 7. The aforesaid findings of fact have been recorded by the Assessing Authority, the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) as well as the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal has assigned cogent reasons for not treating the borrowings as business expenditure incurred during the course of business which is evident from paragraph 6.2 of the order passed by the Tribunal. Therefore, the first substantial question of law does not arise for consideration in this appeal. 8. All the authorities have assigned cogent reasons which has been stated supra and have rejected the claim of the appellant filed under Section 36(1)(iii) of the Act. The second substantial question of law is based on incorrect factual finding inasmuch as the Assessing Authority, Appellate Authority as well as the Tribunal have doubted the genuineness of such a transaction and therefore, the substantial question of law as framed in the absence of any dispute with regard to genuineness of the transaction, whether the Tribunal was justified in rejecting the claim under Section 36(1)(iii) also does not arise for consideration. The Supreme Court in the case of SA BUILDERS LIMITED, supra, has held that it is not in every case that interest on borrowed loan has to be allowed . If the assessee advances it to the sister concern, it all depends on the facts and circumstances of the respective case. Therefore, the question of genuineness of the transaction can be examined in the fact situation of the case. The aforesaid question has been examined in detail by the authorities under the Act by assigning reasons. \n 9. It is once again reiterated that all the authorities under the Act have assigned valid and cogent reasons which is evident from perusal of the orders passed by them. Therefore, by no stretch of imagination, it can be held that the sister concern of the appellant is eligible for more deduction under Section 80HHC of the Act on mere surmise and conjectures. The finding that the sister concern is eligible for more deduction under Section 80HHC of the Act is based on mere surmise and conjectures also does not arise for consideration. \nAccordingly, the aforesaid question of law is answered against the assessee and in favour of the revenue. 10. In view of the preceding analysis, the fourth substantial question of law framed by this Court is also answered against the assessee and in favour of the revenue. \n 11. In the result, we do not find any merit in this appeal. The same fails and is hereby dismissed. \n Sd/- JUDGE Sd/- JUDGE RV",

S.J.M.Vidya Peeta\n          Sri Muruga Mutt\n         Chitradurga 577 502\n          By its President\n         Sri Shivamurthy Murugha\n         Sharanaru. \n\n2. Sri S.H.Patel                    ...PETITIONERS\n         Aged about 80 years\n         Vice President\n         S.J.M.Vidya Peeta\n         Sri Muruga Mutt\n         Chitradurga  577 502. \n\n(By Sri. Parthasarathi M.S., Adv.)\n\nAND:\n\nSri M.Prashanth                     ...RESPONDENT\nS/o Sri K.Mallappa\nAged about 40 years\nHorattagondanahalli Village\nMathodu Hobli  577 533\nHosadurga Taluk.\n\n (By Sri. P.Ravindra, Adv. for\nSri A.R.Holla, Adv.) \n\n         This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 482\nCr.P.C., praying to set aside the order 21.10.2013 on\nC.C.No.768/2013 passed by the Court of Principal Civil\nJudge and JMFC, Hosadurga, Chitradurga District.\n\n         This Petition coming on for hearing this day, the Court\nmade the following:\n\n                                    ORDER This petition is filed by accused Nos.1 and 2 under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. praying the Court to set aside the order dated 21.10.2013 passed in C.C. No.768/2013 by the Court of Principal Civil Judge and JMFC, Hosadurga. 2. It is already observed that the proceedings are abated against petitioner No.2/accused No.2, since he is expired. Therefore, this petition is considered as if it is filed by petitioner No.1/accused No.1 only. 3. The respondent preferred a private complaint under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure alleging that Sri Shivamurthy Murugha Sharanaru is the President of S.J.M. Vidya Peeta and petitioner No.2 is the Secretary of the Management. It is claimed by him that the person who was shown as accused No.3 in the complaint was the administrator acting on behalf of petitioner No.1 and himself fixed Rs.1.40 lakhs as donation and on 24.4.2006, received a sum of Rs.40,000/- and on 2.5.2008, received another sum of Rs.1.00 lakh and issued a letter on the letterhead of Sri Muruga Mutt. The complainant claims that he worked in Sri Basaveshwara Rural High School, Mathodu, till 30th October 2007, he was later transferred to Sri Rudreshwara High School, Habbalu, Davangere District and he also claims that he received training along with other heads of the Educational Institutions run by the petitioners and also office superintendent at Sir M.Vishveshwaraiah Auditorium. It is further stated that the person who was arrayed as the accused No.3 was the administrator of the S.J.M. Vidya Peeta till October 2008 and after that, he was relieved. It is claimed by the complainant that during the month of December 2010, he was transferred to Sri Basaveshwara Rural High School, Mathodu, Hosadurga. It is further stated that when the complainant intended to report to duty at Sri Basaveshwara Rural High School, Mathodu, the Head of the Institution sent the complainant to petitioner Nos.1 and 2 to get the written orders. The complainant went to meet the petitioners and when he met the petitioners with two persons from his village, he claims that the petitioners stated that they should secure appointment from the person to whom he paid the money and it was claimed that the petitioners as would not issue any appointment orders. 4. Heard the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner-accused No.1 and learned counsel for the respondent-complainant .\n 5. Learned counsel for petitioner No.1-accused No.1 made submission that even according to the very allegation in the private complaint, the amount is said to have been collected by accused No.3 and not by accused Nos.1 and 2. Therefore, when it is a specific case in the complaint that it is accused No.3 who collected money, then accused Nos.1 and 2 are not at all held responsible or liable for such act. This aspect has not been taken into consideration by the learned Magistrate while issuing process as against accused Nos.1 and 2. The learned counsel further contended that the complainant submitted a memo before the learned Magistrate that he is not willing to proceed as against accused No.3. Hence, this itself clearly goes to show that the proceedings are initiated at the instance of accused No.3 and there is collusion between accused No.3 and the complainant. Hence, he submitted to allow the petition and set aside the order in so far as it relates to accused No.1. \n 6. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-complainant made submission that accused No.3 collected money of Rs.40,000/- at one point of time and Rs.1.00 lakh at another point of time, totally amounting to Rs.1,40,000/-. Regarding receipt of the said amount, the learned counsel submitted that the receipt was issued on the letter head of accused No.1 and hence, this goes to show that, prima facie, the amount was collected on behalf of accused Nos.1 and 2, though actually the amount has been collected by accused No.3.  Therefore, the learned counsel submitted that there is no merit in the petition and the same is to be rejected. \n 7. I have perused the grounds urged in the petition, the contents of the private complaint, the impugned order passed by the learned Magistrate, and also the copies of sworn statements of P.Ws.1 and 2. I have also considered the oral submissions made by learned counsel for both sides. \n 8. Looking to the materials and the contents of the private complaint, it is the definite case of the complainant himself that the amount was collected by accused No.3. No doubt, looking to the receipt said to have been issued by accused No.3, he has used the letter head of accused No.1. But only on the basis of the said letter head and in the absence of any specific allegation that all the three accused persons with common intention to commit such offence, have collected the money through accused No.3, it cannot be said that the petitioner-accused No.1 has committed the offence. This aspect has not been considered by the learned Magistrate while ordering to issue process even against accused Nos.2 and 3. Apart from that, looking to the contents of the private complaint, respondent- complainant joined the institution and started to serve the institution. The complaint averments goes to show that his salary was not paid and even regarding the place of service, he is having some grievance. So far as this grievance and whatever the salary which is not paid by the institution to the complainant is concerned, the respondent-complainant is having other remedies and he is always at liberty to initiate proceedings for recovery of the said dues under the relevant provisions, if really he is entitled for such amount. So far as the criminal offence is concerned, unless and until, the allegations are made in the complaint against accused No.1, it cannot be assumed that there is prima facie case made out by the respondent-complainant as against accused No.1. \n 9. Hence, petition is allowed. The order impugned herein in so far as issuing process to accused No.1 is concerned , is hereby set aside",

Appellant\n                                 ... Respondent\n                         Versus\n\nState of Madhya Pradesh\n\n                                    J U D G M E N T \n Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, J. \n1. The judgment dated 01.12.2008 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur: Bench Gwalior in Criminal Revision No. 314 of 2007 confirming the order dated 12.03.2007 passed by the XIth Additional Sessions Judge, Gwalior, framing charges against the appellant for the offences punishable under Sections 394 and 460 of the Indian Penal Code (for short `the IPC'), and alternatively under Sections 302 and 397, IPC along with Sections 25 (1B) (a) and 27 of the Arms Act in S.T. No.\n156/99, is called in question in this appeal. 2. The First Information Report came to be lodged against three persons alleging the offence of murder and robbery. A chargesheet was filed against seven persons, including the accused. The Trial Court had discharged the appellant herein initially, along with four other accused, however, the said order of discharge of the appellant was recalled subsequently. The order of recalling was confirmed by the High Court. The said order of recalling came to be set aside by this Court on the ground that there is no provision to review or recall the order under the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short `the Cr.P.C.') by the Criminal Court/Sessions Court. The earlier orders, as mentioned supra, including the order passed by this Court, reveal that the initial order of discharge passed by the Trial Court was without reference to the supplementary chargesheet/additional charge sheet filed against the appellant, which contained ample material against the appellant to frame charges. The supplementary chargesheet also included material relating to the recovery of a pistol used for the commission of the offence by the appellant, at the instance of the appellant. 3. During the trial of the other two accused (since the appellant was discharged at an earlier point of time), an application came to be filed on behalf of the prosecution under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. with regard to the appellant based on the material on record. The Trial Court, being satisfied about the existence of ample material against the appellant to proceed against him on the basis of the supplementary chargesheet, Test Identification Parade, Forensic Science Laboratory report and statements of witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C., as well as depositions of witnesses, issued summons to the appellant herein and thereafter proceeded to frame charges against him. As mentioned supra, the said order came to be confirmed by the High Court. 4. We do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned orders, inasmuch as the Trial Court by duly applying its judicial mind to the facts of the case rightly concluded that it is a fit case to proceed against the appellant in the sessions case. Since, at an earlier point of time the supplementary chargesheet was ignored by the Trial Court while discharging the appellant, there is no bar to proceed against him under Section 319 Cr.P.C. based on the supplementary chargesheet, that too when sufficient material is brought on record against him during the course of trial. The supplementary chargesheet shows that the identification parade was held, wherein the appellant was identified by the witnesses as one of the accused who participated in the incident of murder. The combined effect of the FSL reports as well as the statements of witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C. as found in the supplementary chargesheet and depositions of PW5 (Sreshtha), PW6 (Mukul Gupta), PW7 (Shyam Bihari), PW8 (Rajaram) and PW12 (N. K.\nUpadhyaya) fully justifies the orders of the Trial Court and the High Court under Section 319 of the Cr.P.C. The Courts on facts have correctly found that the material is sufficient, prima facie, to proceed against the appellant for the offence which he appears to have committed, and we concur with their decision. 5. It is relevant to note the following observations of the judgment rendered by a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Hardeep Singh vs. State of Punjab, (2014) 3 SCC 92, which read thus: \"........ The court should keep in mind that the witness when giving evidence against the person so discharged, is not doing so merely to seek revenge or is naming him at the behest of someone or for such other extraneous considerations. The court has to be circumspect in treating such evidence and try to separate the chaff from the grain. If after such careful examination of the evidence, the court is of the opinion that there does exist evidence to proceed against the person so discharged, it may take steps but only in accordance with Section 398 Cr.P.C. without resorting to the provision of Section 319 Cr.P.C. directly.\" \n In the matter on hand, the Sessions Court, as aforementioned, has found that the earlier order of discharge was without reference to the supplementary chargesheet, though the supplementary chargesheet was in existence then. Only after applying its mind judiciously to the facts of the case and on verifying the details of the supplementary chargesheet as well as other material on record, mentioned supra, the Trial Court concluded that it is a fit case to proceed against the accused/appellant under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The said order is confirmed by the High Court. The procedure as contemplated under Section 319 Cr.P.C. as well as the procedure as laid down by this Court in Hardeep Singh (supra) is fully satisfied by the Trial Court. 6. For the reasons aforementioned, we find no reason to interfere with the impugned orders. The appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed. However, we make it clear that any observation made by the Trial Court, the High Court as well as this Court during the course of this order will not come in the way of the Trial Court to decide the sessions case on merits and in accordance with law .\n ...............................................J.\n                                                [N.V.

PW-15, Pratul Kumar Singh, is the owner of Truck bearing no. BRI-7851. PW-16, is Ram Narayan Singh, was Head Watchman of marketing FCI. PW-17, is Ram Sagar Paswan, who was working as AG-III, FCI, Tilrath. PW-18, Rama Rai, is driver of the truck bearing No. BRI-7851. PW-19, is J.K Samuel, who was the Deputy Government Examiner of Questioned documents during the relevant time. PW-20, is Ramphal Yadav, who was employed as AG-II, Tilrath Depot between December 1978 to December 1980 and PW-21, K.N.Sinha, is the Investigating Officer, who has investigated the offence on behalf of the prosecution . 10. On behalf of the defence, one Mr. Anand Mohan Sahay, was examined as DW-1, who is retired as Assistant Depot Manager of FCI. \n Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.  heard  Mr.  Santosh  Mishra  and  Ms.\n 11. We have Aparajita Singh, learned counsels for the appellants and Mr. Ashok Kumar Shrivastava and Mr. P.K. Dey, learned counsel appearing for the CBI. \n 12. In these appeals, it is contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the High Court failed to appreciate the entire material on record, deposition of all witnesses, who were employees of FCI, who have deposed that 500 bags of urea reached the godown on 24th/25th of March, 1980, which is further supported by an Audit Report. \n 13. It is contended that though, the prosecution has mainly relied on the evidence of PW-9, PW-10 and PW-14, truck driver, Khalasi(cleaner) and owner respectively of truck bearing no.BHF-3155, PW-15 and PW-18, the owner and the driver respectively of truck bearing no. BRI-7851, in arriving at the conclusion that 500 bags were not delivered at Tilrath godown, but on a fair perusal of the evidence of the said witnesses, there were several inconsistencies and contradictions. It is submitted that in view of such inconsistencies, in deposition of the witnesses referred above, the Trial Court as well as the High Court has committed an error in relying on the testimony of such witnesses. It is further the case of the appellants that the prosecution has failed to show that there was misappropriation of 1040 bags. On the contrary, the documentary and oral evidence on record suggests that there was complaint of misappropriation of 540 bags only. \n 14. In view of such allegation, the question of mode of transportation of 500 bags does not remain important and the Trial Court as well as the High Court should not have relied on the evidence of the witnesses, related to transportation of 500 bags. It is submitted that the FIR was lodged with regard to only 540 bags but not with regard to 1040 bags of urea, as alleged by the prosecution. \n 15. By referring to the document under Ex.24, it is contended that the said document clearly reveals the delivery of 500 bags of urea in Tilrath godown on 25.03.1980. Further, by referring to the depositions of PW-4 and PW-20, it is stated that such witnesses were involved in the preparation of documents after weighing, counting and stacking of the bags, were competent witnesses, who have deposed the factum of receipt of 500 bags on 24th/25th of March, 1980. It is the case of the appellants that the Trial Court and the High Court ought not to have discarded the evidence of PW-4 and PW-20 in coming to the conclusion that the appellants are guilty for offences alleged. \n      It is submitted that the evidence of PW-4 and PW-20 was not relied on surmises and conjectures, without appreciating such evidence which is not challenged by the prosecution. It is stated that even as per the documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution, arrival tally book (`D' Form), daily receipt register (`G' Form) and Godown stock register (`O' Form) were maintained by different officers based on the entry made by Shiv Shankar Singh in the main gate register. \n 16. Learned counsels, by taking us to the oral and documentary evidence on record, have submitted that though there is no consistency in the evidence recorded by the prosecution and the prosecution has failed to establish the offence alleged against the appellants, the Trial Court has erroneously convicted them for the offences alleged, same is also confirmed by the High Court without appreciating the evidence on record in proper perspective. \n 17. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the State, by referring to oral and documentary evidence on record, has submitted that the evidence adduced by the prosecution is consistent and the prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. It is submitted that though initially a complaint was lodged, based upon which, the F.I.R. was registered alleging that out of 1040 bags of fertilizer, there was misappropriation of only 540 bags of fertilizer, but after the investigation, it revealed that entire 1040 bags of fertilizer were misappropriated, of which, false entries were made to the extent of 500 bags in the records of the F.C.I.\n      godown at Tilrath, so as to show as if 500 bags of urea were arrived. In this regard, the gate pass/register which was to be maintained by the appellant, i.e, Shiv Shankar Prasad Singh, he has falsified the entries with regard to receipt of such 500 bags of fertilizer. Equally, the appellant, namely, Ramdeo Prasad has also falsified the entries which are maintained by him and the `G'-Form and godown stock register in `O'-Form, were tampered and false entries were made to show that such 500 bags of fertilizer were arrived and unloaded. It is submitted from the oral and documentary evidence on record that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt, the conspiracy of all the accused who have committed criminal breach of trust by falsification of accounts.\n      It is submitted, in view of such overwhelming evidence, the Trial Court has rightly convicted and the High Court has rightly confirmed the conviction against the appellants and there are no grounds to interfere with such concurrent findings recorded by the courts below. It is also submitted that having regard to the evidence on record, it cannot be said that the findings recorded are either perverse or erroneous, so as to interfere with the same. Learned counsel submitted that the appeals lack merit and deserve to be dismissed. 18. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we have perused the impugned judgments and the oral and documentary evidence on record. \n 19. At the outset, it is to be noted that the initial complaint was lodged alleging misappropriation of only 540 bags of urea but investigation revealed that entire 1040 bags of urea was misappropriated. It is the specific allegation of the prosecution that the appellants and other accused have conspired with criminal intent and indulged in falsification of accounts. Out of 1040 bags of urea, 500 bags were shown to have loaded in the trucks bearing nos.BRI- 7851 and BHF-3155 with 250 bags each for delivering the same at F.C.I. godown at Tilrath but it was found that there was no actual delivery of such fertiliser bags and the F.C.I. records were falsified. The specific case of the prosecution against Shiv Shankar Prasad Singh, the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1804 of 2011 is that he was responsible for making entries in the register at the gate and he has made false entries of arrival of such 500 bags of urea though such fertiliser was not actually delivered. Similarly and correspondingly, in the further registers in `O' Form and `G' Form, false entries were made for which Ramdeo Prasad is responsible.          Merely because misappropriation of 540 bags of urea is mentioned in the initial complaint, we cannot ignore the chargesheet which was filed after investigation which revealed misappropriation of entire qualtity of 1040 bags of urea. Same is clear from the deposition of the investigating officer who was examined as P.W.21.\n  It is clear from the evidence on record, that so far as 500 bags of urea are concerned though they were loaded in the two trucks bearing nos.BRI-7851 and BHF- 3155 but they were not taken to the F.C.I. godown at Tilrath and false entries were made in the main gate register and other registers which are being maintained in `O' Form and `G' Form to show as if such quantity of fertiliser was delivered. \n 20. It is not in dispute that the appellant, Shiv Shankar Singh was functioning as AG-III during the relevant time and he was incharge of receipt of consignment at the Depot. Further evidence also makes it clear that the appellant Shiv Shankar Prasad Singh has shown arrival of trucks bearing BRI-7851 and BHF- 3155 on 25.03.1980 with 250 bags of urea each. It is also clear from the evidence on record that the physical verification was carried out between 06.10.1982 and 06.11.1982 and just prior to that, chart (Ext.24) was brought into existence on 01.10.1982, indicating that 500 bags of urea were delivered in two trucks. It is the case of the prosecution that the document which is prepared under Ext.24 (the chart) is not a document which is required to be maintained in the official course of business and same is got prepared only to show that the stock of fertiliser is arrived at, though actually it was not brought. So far as deposition of PW-17, i.e, of Ram Sagar Paswan is concerned, same is not relied on by the prosecution and he was declared hostile. \n 21. Learned counsel for the appellants has made much emphasis on the evidence of PW-4 and PW-20, who have spoken about the delivery of 500 bags of urea on 25.03.1980 on the basis of Ext.24, but it is to be noted that such document under Ext.24 is a document which is prepared much after filing of the FIR. The incident has occurred in the month of March 1980 and the document under Ext.24 was brought into existence only on 01.10.1982. The said evidence if considered alongwith the other oral and documentary evidence on record, it falsifies the case of the appellants. It is also clear from the evidence on record that one of the trucks was, in fact, used for transporting 250 bags of urea on 25.03.1980, but instead of delivering the said bags at FSD FCI, Tilrath, the truck was diverted and such commodity of fertiliser was delivered at Manjhaul which is a different place. It is also clear from the evidence on record, another truck bearing no.BRI-7851 which is allegedly used in carrying 250 bags of urea was never employed at all for carrying fertiliser. There is no reason to discard such positive evidence on record which clinchingly proved the guilt of the accused. The trial court as well as the appellate court has rightly relied upon deposition of owners, driver and khalasi of the vehicles in question. \n      22. Considering the totality of oral and documentary evidence on record, we are of the view that the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Having regard to evidence on record, it cannot be said that findings recorded by the trial court, as affirmed by the appellate court, are either perverse or erroneous so as to interfere with the same. Apart from the allegation of misappropriation with criminal intent there is specific case of the prosecution that all the accused have conspired and are punishable for offence under Section 120B of the I.P.C. It is further to be noted that Special Leave Petition being SLP(Crl.) No.4005 of 2009 filed by the other accused, i.e, Ram Nath Sharma @ Ram Nath Prasad Sharma is already dismissed by this Court, at the stage of Special Leave Petition, by order dated 24.07.2009. \n      23. For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any merit in these appeals, same are accordingly dismissed. Consequently, the bail bonds of the appellants stand cancelled. The appellants shall surrender to serve the remaining sentence, within a period of four weeks from today. Failing such surrender within the time, it is open to the respondents to take necessary steps against the accused. \n .....................

FROM THE DATE OF PETITION TILL DEPOSIT. THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR FINAL HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING: JUDGMENT The present appellant- Insurance Company was respondent No.3 in the Tribunal below. The present respondent No.1 was the claimant in the Tribunal below. \n 2. The summary of the case of the claimant in the Tribunal below was that, on 24.12.2005 at about 3.15 pm, the claimant, minor in age, along with his mother while returning from Kolahalli after attending a fair (Jatra) in auto rickshaw bearing registration No.KA-48/147 on Yaragatti  Ramadurga road, near Saidappa Maddannavar farm house, a KSRTC bus bearing registration No.KA- 29/F-600 being driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner, dashed the side of the body of auto rickshaw, due to which accident the claimant sustained injuries. It is the further case of the claimant that he took treatment in different hospital for which he spent more than `20,000/-. In his claim petition, the claimant has stated that the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the bus as well the auto rickshaw. Stating so, he has claimed a total compensation of a sum of `5,00,000/- holding the Corporation of the bus, owner and insurer of the auto rickshaw as the respondents 1, 2 and 3 respectively before the Tribunal. \n The Tribunal below after recording the evidence led before it and hearing the arguments addressed before it, was pleased to allow the claim petition in part holding that the claimant before it was entitled for a compensation of a sum of `1,64,850/- with interest at the rate of 6% p.a.\nthereon. It held respondent No.1 before it, which was the owner-cum insurer of the alleged offending bus and respondent No.3, the insurer of another alleged offending vehicle, i.e., auto rickshaw, as equally liable to pay compensation at the rate of 50:50 to the claimant. It is the said judgment and award, the insurer of the auto rickshaw has challenged in this appeal. \n 3. Learned counsel for the appellant  Insurance Company in his argument vehemently submitted that the complaint as well as the charge sheet filed in the criminal case pertaining to the accident clearly mentions that the driver at fault was the driver of the bus, but not of the auto rickshaw. As such, the Tribunal ought to have fastened the negligence at 100% upon the driver of the bus and saddled 100% liability on the Corporation of the bus, which is respondent No.2 herein. \n 4. The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that in the absence of any pleading regarding the rash and negligent driving on the part of the auto rickshaw driver, the evidence of P.W.1 about the alleged negligence on the part of the auto rickshaw driver cannot be looked into. It was the further argument of the said learned counsel that for arriving at a conclusion that there was any contributory negligence on the part of the vehicle, it is necessary that all the offending vehicles ought to have stopped in the spot of the accident. Since in the instant case, the bus has left the place after the accident, it cannot be inferred that there was any contributory negligence of all the vehicles involved in the accident. \n 5. On the other hand, the argument of the learned counsel for respondent No.2-Corporation was that, a mere complaint and charge sheet cannot be a conclusive proof when in fact P.W.1, who was an eyewitness cum passenger in the auto rickshaw herself has stated that the accident has taken place due to the fault of both the drivers. It was her further argument that, scene of offence Panchanama at Ex.P4 shows that the road was of the width of 19.5'. When the bus came from the opposite side, after seeing it, the driver of the auto rickshaw was not bothered to take his vehicle to the left side of the road paving the way for the bus, the same is clear in the evidence of P.W.1. As such, the negligence is solely on the part of the driver of the auto rickshaw, but not of the bus. \n 6. With respect to the accident in question, a criminal case was filed before the competent police. A certified copy of the said complaint lodged before the police has been produced and marked by the claimant as Ex.P3. In the said complaint, the complainant who claimed herself as one of the inmates of the auto rickshaw at the time of accident, has stated as below:  \" ZP  Dm w g  V Az UĪU  AQ A q r DmjPz  Uq  zA qU  PwgĪ   g  U ZA   U z Z ߧ Ej U r CWvr   UA i z g P ø Aq Pq U  Vz z j CWvz    U  g  E U Uq vqU qU  UAiĪV vU  jz gP  jzݮz , Uq  sdP U g PqU  MmVz Z ߧ E U Uq  zP  UAiĪV gP  g  v z, zj Dm jP wjVPAq ƸArU g  CW v r z Aq   Awv.\" \n 7. As per the charge sheet, copy of which is produced at Ex.P8, it may be seen that the driver of the NWKRTC bus was charged for the offence punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of IPC. Referring these two documents, learned counsel for the appellant in his argument vehemently submitted that, when the complaint as well as the charge sheet accuses solely the driver of the bus, the Tribunal below was not right in holding that the accident was due to the composite negligence and it was also not right in apportioning the liability at 50:50 among those two vehicles. \n 8. It cannot be forgotten that a complaint lodged in a criminal case or charge sheet said to have been filed in a criminal case cannot be the conclusive proof of any event or incident. A complaint is merely an information given to a police to put the ball of criminal investigation into motion. A charge sheet is nothing but a final report what the Investigating Officer is said to have been found out in his investigation. Both those documents cannot be considered as a final conclusion regarding occurrence of the accident in the manner alleged or stated therein. However, they are of some assistance in a motor vehicle claim cases to analyze the occurrence of sequence and to arrive at a just and proper conclusion regarding occurrence of the accident. It is for this reason, in several cases in spite of the fact that acquittal of the driver of the alleged offending vehicle in a criminal case, a Tribunal would fasten the liability upon the owner and insurer of the said offending vehicle observing or holding that the driver of that vehicle was found to have driven that vehicle in a rash and negligent manner in causing the accident. Therefore, merely because the complainant has stated that the bus touched the body of the auto rickshaw and merely the fact that a charge sheet has been filed against the driver of the bus, it cannot be concluded that the driver of the bus was solely responsible for causing the accident. In such a situation, the Motor Vehicle Claims Tribunal is required to independently assess the evidence placed before it in a proper perspective. \n 9. In the instant case, admittedly, the complainant who is said to have lodged the complaint before the police has not been examined. At the same time, neither the driver of the auto rickshaw nor the driver of the bus was examined. The only witness who was examined and who threw some light regarding the manner of occurrence of the accident is none else than the guardian of the minor claimant Smt.Champawwa, who incidentally is also stated to have been traveling in the very same auto rickshaw at the time of accident. As such, in addition to her capacity as mother of the minor claimant, she is also an eye- witness to the incident. The said witness in her examination-in-chief has stated as below:  \"z j Cm jP M z  zݣߪg  JAĪ g vlz ģA i w g AigUn g P g Ai ï g P AiįgĪU JzgUq  Az MAz P. J.Dg.n..  A .PJ -29: Js -600  zg ZP Cw ejAz ̼f Az q v Az Cm jP ZP  jAiiV P U Ez  EzU A rU Ĺzݣ. z j   juĪV   U Z  īU U zP  s j l UAiĪv v zz JħU  jz P deVv Czg A v Evg jU l UAiU Vzݪ.\" At the later part of her examination in chief, she has specifically stated as below:  \"z j CWv P. J.Dg.n..  A .PJ - 29:J-600 v C Cm jP A .PJ -48:147 zgU  ZPg  v Az DVgvz. \" This shows that the eyewitness to the alleged accident at the first place, though has stated that the driver of the bus was negligent in his driving, but also shows that, had the driver of the auto rickshaw got the vehicle on the left side) of the road, the accident could have been avoided. This is the reason why she has arrayed both the vehicles as offending vehicles in her claim petition and also averred in specific terms that the accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the drivers of both the vehicles. \n 9. In addition to this, it also cannot be ignored that the very same P.W.1 in her cross-examination, apart from denying the suggestion made from the owner of the bus side that there was no fault on the part of the driver of bus, she has specifically stated as below:  \"  jP  U V V U rv xxxxxx CAzg jP v   Jgq   U V Az CWvv.  ZP  U V Uwۮ Cߪz j C. jP ZP  v Az CWvVz CAzg Jgq   U  ZPg  v Az CWv Vz. \" She has further stated in her cross-examination made from the Insurance Company side that:  \" U 죪 g  j g Pq  P, Cmzg j g Pq  zsg CAzg Eg zsg Eg Pq P.   itvz  죪 g z  v  Ez Eg j g Pq  P CAzg, Jgq  ZPg  v  Ez. \" The said evidence of P.W.1, who is none else than the eyewitness in the incident makes it very clear that the accident has occurred not due to the alleged rash and negligent driving of the driver of the bus alone, but it was a composite negligence on the part of both the drivers of the bus as well as the auto rickshaw. Thus, when the eyewitness has given her evidence and subjected herself for a thorough cross-examination from the opposite side, her evidence gets some weightage in visualizing the fact of the manner of occurrence of the accident rather than mere complaint, which is only a report and a charge sheet, the authors of which did not present them for cross- examination. Therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that, when the complaint and the charge sheet are fingering at the driver of the bus, the Tribunal below was wrong in holding that there was composite negligence of both the vehicles, cannot be accepted. \n 10. The learned counsel for the appellant referring to a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Oriental Insurance Company Limited Vs. Premlata Shukla and Others reported in (2009) 1 SCC (Cri) 204, submitted that, when the complaint and charge sheet have been produced by none else than the claimant, the same has to be relied upon. The said submission of the learned counsel for the appellant cannot be admitted in toto as was placed before this Court for the reason that, in the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court while analyzing Sections 58 and 61 of the Evidence Act, 1872 regarding proof of contents of the documents and admission of parties, a mode of proof of a document, was placed to hold that, where parts of a document have been relied on by both the parties, the Claims Tribunal may rely on the same irrespective of whether the contents of the document have been proved or not. By stating so, what the Hon'ble Supreme Court has shown is that, a document that has been produced by one of the party is required to be relied on by both the parties before the Claims Tribunal. Whereas, in the instant case, the document was produced by the claimant, who in addition to the same, tendered herself for cross- examination as P.W.1. Moreover, respondent No.1 in the Tribunal below, which was the Corporation for the bus did not accept those documents and did not rely on those documents. As such, the requirement that both the parties should rely on the document falls short of fulfillment in the instant case. As such, the said judgment would not be of any favour to the appellant herein .\n 11. In addition to the above, it also cannot be ignored that the scene of offence (Spot Panahanama) produced in the Tribunal below and marked at Ex.P4 shows that the public road on which the accident has occurred was of 19 feet 5 inch width and on that side of the road where the auto rickshaw was there, there was still a distance of 5 feet, which means, after seeing the bus coming from the opposite direction, there was a space and place for the auto rickshaw to go to its left, but panchanama shows that it has not gone. Though the Tribunal below has not considered all these aspects in such a detail, however, it has arrived at a right conclusion holding that there was composite negligence on the part of the drivers of both the offending vehicles. However, the only aspect where the Tribunal below has committed an error is, in equally apportioning the liability on both the vehicles. While fixing the liability upon each of the vehicles at 50%, it ignored the fact that one among the vehicle was a heavy transport vehicle, whereas the other one, i.e., auto rickshaw was a small passenger carrier with sitting capacity of three passengers only. Had that aspect been considered by the Tribunal below along with scene of offence (Spot Panchanama) at Ex.P4, the percentage of apportionment of liability would have been a little bit on the higher side upon the bus to that of the auto rickshaw. \n Thus, I am of the view that, in the instant case and for the reasons mentioned above, the said apportionment required to be re-fixed at 70:30 between NWKRTC bus versus auto rickshaw, which are the vehicles involved in the accident. As such, there is necessity to interfere with the judgment and award under appeal for some modification. 12. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following order: ORDER The appeal is allowed in part. \n        The judgment and award dated 15.06.2009 passed by the V Additional MACT, Jamkhandi in MVC No.151/2007 is modified to the extent that the apportionment of liability, which was fixed at 50:50 upon respondent No.1(Managing Director NWKRTC) versus respondent No.3(Divisional Manager United India Insurance Co.Ltd.) is set aside and the said apportionment is re-fixed at 70:30 between respondent Nos.1 and 3 in the Tribunal below.\n Barring this, the judgment and award under appeal remain unaltered. The amount in deposit, if any, made by the appellant in the registry be transferred to the Tribunal below without any delay. \n Sd/- JUDGE gab/MBS/-",

(open court) 1.Seeking the quashing of Complaint Case No. 76/1 pending in the court of learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi („ACMM‟) titled Satnam Pal v. Medisphere Marketing Ltd. & Ors., the Petitioners, i.e. M/s. Medisphere Marketing Ltd., M/s. Medisource Agencies Private Limited, Mr. Rajan Bajaj, Chairman-cum-Managing Director and Ms. Renu R. Bajaj, Director, respectively of M/s. Medisphere Marketing Ltd. have filed this petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (CrPC). The petition also seeks the setting aside of an order dated 19 th May 1999 passed by the ACMM dismissing the application filed by the Petitioners seeking discharge. \n 2.The facts leading to the filing of this petition are that the Petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 companies are engaged in the business of distribution of medicines. \n These Petitioners inter alia imported IV Cannulas viz. Vasculon, Neoflon, and Venflon at nil rate of customs duty against proper Bills of Entry taking benefit of the Exemption Notification No. 23/98 Cus. On 23 rd August 1998 the Customs raided the godowns of Petitioners 1 and 2 and seized certain medicines all of foreign origin valued at Rs. 1,31,45,000/-. Alleging that there was a misdeclaration of the goods and therefore a fraudulent evasion of customs duty, the Customs initiated proceedings both departmentally as well as in the criminal court. A show cause notice dated 18 th February 1999 was issued under Section 124 of the Customs Act, 1962 to which the Petitioners replied. Meanwhile a complaint dated 19th May 1999 was filed in the court of the learned ACMM for the offences under Sections 132 and 135(1) (a) of the Customs Act, 1962. 3.The Commissioner of Customs on 4th May 2000 disposed of the show cause notice by holding that the Petitioners were not entitled to the benefit of the exemption. Accordingly an order was passed by him inter alia imposing penalty on the Petitioners. The appeal filed by the Petitioners was allowed by the Customs, Excise Gold Control Appellate Tribunal („CEGAT‟) reversing the order of the Commissioner of Customs and holding that the Petitioners were entitled to avail of the exemption. The penalty imposed on the Petitioners was consequently set aside. The Department filed Special Leave Petition („SLP‟) against the orders passed by the CEGAT. On 7 th February 2003 the Supreme Court dismissed the SLP. A refund order was passed by the Department on 1st September 2003. 4. On the strength of the orders passed by the CEGAT and the Supreme Court, the Petitioners applied to the ACMM for dropping of proceedings. \n By the impugned order dated 22nd November 2003 the learned ACMM dismissed the applications holding that the order passed by the CEGAT was not binding on the criminal court. Thereafter the present petition was filed in February 2002. On 20th September, 2004 this Court stayed further proceedings before the trial court. 5. The contention of the learned counsel for the Petitioner is that on the strength of the recent judgments of this Court in Surkhi Lal v. Union of India 131 (2006) DLT 12 and Sunil Gulati v. RK Vohra 2007 [1] JCC 22, this Court should quash the criminal proceedings since the departmental proceedings on a lesser degree of proof on the same set of facts have already been decided in favour of the Petitioners. It is submitted that the entire basis of the criminal prosecution that the Petitioners were not entitled to the exemption has been conclusively negatived by the CEGAT, and its order has been upheld by the Supreme Court. It is submitted that consequently there is no question of the Petitioners being prosecuted for the offences of misdeclaration of goods or evasion of customs duty in terms of Section 132 or 135 (1) (b) of the Act. \n 6. The point regarding exoneration in departmental proceedings and the consequent unsustainability in law of the criminal proceedings launched simultaneously has been discussed extensively in earlier judgments of both the Supreme Court as well as of this Court. In Surkhi Lal after discussing the judgments of the Supreme Court in The Assistant Collector of Customs, Bombay v. L.R. Melwani AIR 1970 SC 962, Uttam Chand v. Income Tax Officer, Central Circle, Amritsar, (1982) 2 SCC 543, P. Jayappan v.\n S.K.Perumal AIR 1984 SC 1693 and G.L.Didwania v. Income Tax Officer 1999 (108) ELT 16 (SC), this Court held as under: “The legal principles that can be evolved from the series of judgments quoted above are as under: (a) Departmental proceedings are different from trial and so if the departmental proceedings end in favour of the accused the criminal trial is not hit by the principle of autre fois acquit. \n (b) the departmental proceedings and the criminal proceedings can proceed side by side. \n (c) if the departmental proceedings end in a finding in favour of the accused in respect of the allegations which also form the basis for the criminal proceedings then the departmental adjudication will remove the very basis of the criminal proceedings and in such situation the continuance of the criminal proceedings will be a futile exercise and an abuse of the process of the Court. ” 7. The above declaration of the law was reiterated by this court in Sunil Gulati in the following words:  “1. On the same violation alleged against a person, if adjudication proceedings as well as criminal proceedings are permissible, both can be initiated simultaneously.        For initiating criminal proceedings one does not have to wait for the outcome of the adjudication proceedings as the two proceedings are independent in nature. 2. The findings in the departmental proceedings would not amount to resjudicata and initiation of criminal proceedings in these circumstances can be treated as double jeopardy as they are not in the nature of “prosecution”. 3. In case adjudication proceedings are decided against a person who is facing prosecution as well and the Tribunal has also upheld the findings of the adjudicators/assessing authority, that would have no bearing on the criminal proceedings and that criminal proceedings are to be determined on its own merits in accordance with law, uninhibited by the findings of the Tribunal. It is because of the reason that in so far as criminal action is concerned, it has to be proved as per the strict standards fixed for criminal cases before the criminal court by producing necessary evidence. 4. In case of converse situation namely where the accused persons are exonerated by the competent authorities/Tribunal in adjudication proceedings/Tribunal in adjudication proceedings, one will have to see the reasons for such exoneration to determine whether these criminal proceedings could still continue. If the exoneration in departmental adjudication is on technical ground or by giving benefit of doubt and not on merits of the adjudication proceedings were on different facts, it would have no bearing on criminal proceedings. If, on the other hand, the exoneration in the adjudication proceedings is on merits and it is found that allegations are not substantiated at all and the concerned person(s) is/are innocent, and the criminal prosecution is also on the same set of facts and circumstances, the criminal prosecution cannot be allowed to continue. The reason is obvious criminal complaint is filed by the departmental authorities alleging violation/contravention of the provisions of the Act on the part of the accused persons.      However, if the departmental authorities themselves, in adjudication proceedings, record a categorical and unambiguous finding that there is no such contravention of the provisions of the Act, it would be unjust for such departmental authorities to continue with the criminal complaint and say that there is sufficient evidence to foist the accused persons with criminal liability when it is stated in the departmental proceedings that ex- facie there is no such violation. The yardstick would, therefore, be to see as to whether charges in the departmental proceedings as well as criminal complaint are identical and the exoneration of the concerned person in the departmental proceedings is on merits holding that there is no contravention of the provisions of any Act.” (emphasis supplied) 8.   More recently this Court held likewise in Kamal Suri v. Dy. Director, Enforcement Directorate (CRL.M.C. 2655/2006 decided on 11th January, 2008) while quashing the criminal proceedings launched simultaneously with adjudication proceedings under the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act. \n 9. Mr. Satish Aggarwala, learned counsel for the department does not contest the factual position. Nevertheless he submits that in the judgment of in Standard Chartered Bank .v. Directorate of Enforcement 2006 [1] JCC 488 the Supreme Court had held that result of the departmental adjudication proceedings were not conclusive and binding on the criminal court and that in one of the cases in the batch of matters that were decided the judgment of the High Court that had decided in a manner similar to Surkhi Lal and Sunil Gulati was set aside. He also refers to the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in State v. M. Krishana Mohan 2007 (4) C.C.Cases (SC) 140 where it was held that the exoneration in departmental proceedings cannot automatically led to closure of the criminal case in a situation where the departmental enquiry was completed even before the investigation in the criminal case commenced. \n 10. In the first place it requires to be noticed that this Court in Sunil Gulati noted that the central issue in Standard Chartered Bank was whether criminal proceedings could be launched simultaneous with departmental proceedings and that question was answered in the affirmative. The question whether, after the criminal proceedings were launched simultaneously, the exoneration in the adjudication proceedings would impact the pending criminal proceedings was not answered directly in Standard Chartered Bank but in the earlier judgments of the Supreme Court including Uttam Chand. \n 11. This Court views the observations Standard Chartered Bank to the effect that the finding in adjudication proceedings are not to be viewed as binding and conclusive on the criminal proceedings, while not overruling the earlier judgments Uttam Chand and PS Rajya vs. State of Bihar (1996) 9 SCC 1, as meaning this: if the Department is able to show the court that irrespective of the departmental/adjudication proceedings which have resulted in total exoneration, there is some other independent evidence, not considered in the adjudication proceedings, on the basis of which the conviction could be obtained in the criminal court, then and only then can it be said that the findings of the departmental/adjudication proceedings will not bind the criminal court. If there is no other independent evidence and on the very same material which forms the basis of the prosecution there has been an exoneration in the departmental proceedings, which has attained finality, then it will be futile to keep the criminal proceedings on the same material pending in the criminal courts. \n 12. The recent judgment in State v. M. Krishana Mohan does not alter this settled position. There the departmental enquiry was completed even before the investigation in the criminal case commenced. Therefore, that case is clearly distinguishable on facts.     Here the criminal proceedings were launched simultaneously and departmental proceedings ended in exoneration long after the criminal proceedings commenced. \n 13. In that view of the matter, this Court holds that the Criminal Complaint No. 76/1 and all proceedings consequent thereto including the order dated 19th May, 1999 of the learned ACMM is unsustainable in law and hereby quashes them. The petition is allowed but in the circumstances with no order as to costs. \n S. MURALIDHAR, J JANUARY 24, 2008 dn",

The head office drew the\nproduction programme and advised the factory to manufacture\nthe goods in accordance therewith. After the goods were so\nmanufactured in the factory they were collected by the head\noffice and brought to Delhi and despatched to various\ncustomers whether outside Delhi or in Delhi. The price of\ngoods was received at the head office. In other words\nexcepting the manufacture of goods at the factory all other\nactivities, were carried out from the head office in Delhi. \n\n         In respect of sale of goods manufactured at Faridabad\nthe respondent company filed sales tax returns with the\nsales tax authorities at Delhi on the ground that the sales\nwere effected from Delhi by the head office and that they\nwere intra-state sales within the territory of Delhi and\naccordingly paid sales tax at Delhi. \n\n         In November, 1965, however, the sales tax authorities\nof Haryana demanded payment of sales tax under the East\nPunjab General Sales Tax, Act, 1948 for the period\ncommencing from April 1, 1961 and ending with the year 1964-\n65 pointing out that the sales effected were inter-state\nsales liable to be assessed by them under the Central Sales\nTax Act, 1956. \n\n         In its writ petition the respondent-company alleged\nthat since all its activities were being carried on by or\nthrough the head office in Delhi and no sales were effected\nby or from the factory at Faridabad sales tax was paid by it\nin Delhi and since the sales tax authorities in Haryana were\n\ndemanding payment of Central Sales Tax in respect of the\nsame transaction the High Court might resolve the\ncontroversy. \n\n         The High Court held that the sales fell under s. 3(a)\nof the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 and were liable to be\nassessed to inter-state sales tax by the Sales Tax\nAuthorities at Faridabad and accordingly ordered that the\nsales tax paid by the respondent in Delhi be transferred to\nthe Sales Tax Authorities at Faridabad.\n\n          On appeal the Union of India contended that since the\nsitus of sale was Delhi Sales Tax was payable in Delhi. \n\n         Dismissing the appeal,\n454\n^\n\n         HELD: 1 (a) The High Court was right in holding that\nthe sales were inter state sales and that the turnover on\nsales was assessable to sales tax under the Central Sales\nTax Act, 1956 and that the amounts of sales tax wrongly paid\nin Delhi be transferred to the Sales Tax Authorities at\nFaridabad. [462 A-B ]\n\n         (b) In order that a sale may be regarded as an inter-\nstate sale it is immaterial whether the property in the\ngoods passes in one State or another. The question as\nregards the nature of the sale, that is, whether it is an\ninter State sale or an intra-State sale does not depend upon\nthe circumstance as to in which State the property in the\ngoods passes. It may pass in either and yet the sale can be\nan inter-State sale. [461 G-H, 462 A] \n\n         In the instant case the contracts of sales were made at\nDelhi and in pursuance of those contracts, goods were\nmanufactured at Faridabad according to specifications\nmentioned in the contracts. This, therefore, is not that\ntype of case in which goods are manufactured in the general\ncourse of business for being sold as and when offers are\nreceived by the manufacturer for their purchase. Contracts\nof sales were finalised in the instant case at Delhi and\nspecific goods were manufactured at Faridabad in pursuance\nof those contracts. These were \"future goods\" within the\nmeaning of s. 2(6) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. After the\ngoods were manufactured to agreed specifications, they were\ndespatched to the head office at Delhi for being forwarded\nto the respective customers at whose instance and pursuant\nto the contracts with whom the goods were manufactured. The\ndespatch of goods of Delhi was but a convenient made of\nsecuring the performance of contracts made at Delhi. Thus\nthe movement of goods was occasioned from Faridabad to Delhi\nas a result or incident of the contracts of sale made in\nDelhi. [458 H, 459 A-D\n\n         (c) For the purpose of s. 3(a) it is not necessary that\nthe contract of sale must itself provide for and cause the\nmovement of goods or that the movement of goods must be\noccasioned specifically in accordance with the terms of\ncontract of sale.

From the Judgment and Order dated 2-8-1971 of the Delhi High Court in Civil Writ No. 162-D of 1966. \n         E. C. Agarwala and R. N. Sachthey for the Appellants. \n         Lal Narain Sinha, K. K. Jain, S. K. Gupta, Pramod Dayal and Bishamber Lal for the Respondent No. 1 455 Rameshwar Dial, Adarsh Fial, and A. D. Mathur for Respondents 2-3. \n The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, C. J. -This appeal by certificate raises an interesting controversy between the Sales Tax Authorities in the Union Territory of Delhi and those in Haryana, the question being as to which of the two authorities can assess respondent 1 to sales tax. One of the reliefs sought by respondent 1 is that until the Sales Tax authorities of the two territories settle their differences, no sales tax should be levied or recovered from it since, it does not know to whom to pay the tax. This controversy arises on the following facts. \n         Respondent 1 is a private limited company called K. G.\nKhosla & Co. (P) Ltd., having its head office in the Union Territory of Delhi at 1, Deshbandhu Gupta Road, New Delhi. \nThe company carries on business in Air Compressors and garage equipment which it manufactures in its factory at Faridabad, which was formerly in the State of Punjab and is now a part of the State of Haryana. \n         For the purposes of sales tax, respondent 1 is registered as a dealer both in the Union Territory of Delhi and in the State of Haryana. It filed returns of sales tax with the sales Tax authorities in Delhi since, according to it, the sale of goods manufactured in the factory at Faridabad was being effected from Delhi by its head office. \nThe sales tax was being paid by the company under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 as extended to Delhi, on the basis that the sales effected by the company were intra- State sales within the territory of Delhi. On November 24, 1965, however, the Sales Tax Assessing Authority at Gurgaon, which was then in the State of Punjab but which subsequently became a part of the State of Haryana, sent a notice to the company under sections 11 and 14 of the East Punjab Central Sales Tax Act, 1948 and rule 33 made thereunder that, in respect of the period commencing on April 1, 1961 and ending with the year 1964-65, the sales made by the company were liable to assessment in Haryana. On March 13, 1968 an assessment was made by the Assessing Authority at Faridabad on the basis that the sales effected by the company were inter-State sales liable to be assessed to sales tax under the Central Sales Tax Act, 74 of 1956. An appeal against the order of assessment is said to be pending. \n         In the meanwhile, on February 14, 1966, the company filed a writ petition before the Punjab High Court Circuit Bench at Delhi which, after the recorganisation of States, was dealt with by the Delhi High 456 Court. The Chief Commissioner of the Union Territory of Delhi and the Assessing Authority of the territory were impleaded as respondents 1 and 2 to the writ petition. \nRespondent 3 was the State of Punjab and respondent 4 the Assessing Authority at Gurgaon. Respondent 3 was later substituted by the State of Haryana. \n The company contended by its writ petition that except the manufacturing of goods at the Faridabad factory, all of its activities, including those of booking of orders, sales, despatching of goods, billing and receiving of sale price were being done by and through the head office in Delhi and that no sales were effected by or from the factory. Since, however, both the Sales Tax authorities, namely, at Delhi and Haryana, were demanding payment of sales tax on the same sale transactions, the company prayed by its writ petition that the High Court do resolve the controversy between the Sales Tax authorities of the two States and decide the question of their respective jurisdiction to assess its turnover. The State of Haryana contended by its counter affidavit to the writ petition that the goods were manufactured by the company at Faridabad in pursuance of contracts of sale with outside purchasers, that those goods were appropriated to the various contracts of sale in the State of Haryana and that the movement of the goods from Faridabad to Delhi and onwards was caused as a necessary incident of the contracts of sale made by the company. The sales, according to the State of Haryana had taken place at Faridabad during the course of inter-State trade. \n The Union of India, on the other hand, contended that the goods were brought from Faridabad to Delhi and were thereafter sold by the company to the various purchasers outside Delhi. These sales according to the Union of India, were governed by the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 as extended to Delhi, their situs being the Union Territory of Delhi. \n The Delhi High Court by its judgment dated August 2, 1971 allowed the writ petition and granted a declaration that the sales effected by respondent 1 which fell under section 3 (a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 were liable to be assessed to inter-State sales tax by the Sales Tax authorities at Faridabad since, those sales caused the movement of goods from Faridabad to Delhi. The High Court added that the writ petition was confined to the goods manufactured at Faridabad in pursuance of pre-existing contracts of sales and therefore, its judgment would have no application to the local sales 457 effected by respondent 1 at Delhi. In the result, the High Court passed an order directing that the amount of tax which respondent 1 had wrongly paid to the sales tax authorities at Delhi on the inter-State sales between 1.4.1961 to 30-9- 1965 be transferred by the Sales Tax authorities at Delhi to the Sales Tax authorities at Faridabad. The High Court has granted a certificate of fitness to the Union of India to file an appeal to this Court under Article 133, (1) (b) of the Constitution. \n The question which arises for decision is whether the sales made by respondent 1 were made at Faridabad in the course of inter-State trade as contended by the State of Haryana or whether they are intra-State sales effected within the Union Territory of Delhi as contended by the appellant, the Union of India. The answer to this question would depend upon the course and nature of transactions in relation to which the movement of goods was caused from Faridabad to Delhi and the terms of the contracts of sales which caused that movement. But before adverting to those aspects of the matter, it would be necessary to notice the relevant provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act 74 of 1956 (\"The Act\"). \n         Section 3 of the Act provides as follows: \"3. When is a sale or purchase of goods said to take place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce:- A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce if the sale or purchase:- (a) occasions the movement of goods from one State to another; or (b) is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods during their movement from one State to another.\" \n There are two Explanations to the section but they have no bearing on the appeal. \n Section 9(1) of the Act provides as follows:- 9. \"Levy and collection of tax and penalties (1) the tax payable by any dealer under this Act on sales of goods effected by him in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, whether such sales fall within clause (a) or clause (b) of section 3, shall be levied by the Government of India and the tax so levied shall be collected by that Government 458 in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2), in the State from which the movement of the goods commenced.\" \nThere is a proviso to section 9(1) to which it is unnecessary to refer since it has no application. \n         In the light of these provisions, what has to be considered is whether the sales effected by respondent 1 occasioned the movement of goods from one State to another State, which on the facts of the instant case would mean, from the State of Haryana to the Union Territory of Delhi. \nIt is only if a sale occasions the movement of goods from one State to another that it can be deemed to have taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce within the meaning of section 3 (a) of the Act. Clause (b) of section 3 is not relevant for our purpose. \n         The course and manner of its business have been set out by respondent 1 in paragraphs 3 and 27 of the writ petition in the following terms: \"3. Orders for the supply of goods from various parties are received by the petitioner's company at its head office in Delhi. The head office draws out a production programme and advises the factory to manufacture the goods in accordance therewith. After the goods are so manufactured in the factory, the goods are collected by the head office and brought to its head office in Delhi. From its head office the goods are despatched to various customers whether outside Delhi or in Delhi. The price of goods is also received at the head office. In short, the position is that excepting the manufacture of goods at the factory, all other activities including that of booking of orders, sales, despatching and billing and receiving of sale price are being carried out from the head office in Delhi.\" \"27. The goods manufactured in the factory are future goods within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act and the dispute does not relate to any ready goods.\"\n          It is clear from these averments that goods were manufactured by respondent 1 in its factory at Faridabad, Haryana, in pursuance of specific orders received by its head office at Delhi. The contracts of sales were made at Delhi and in pursuance of those contracts, goods were manufactured at Faridabad according to specifications mentioned in the contracts. This, therefore, is not that type of case in which goods are manufactured in the general course of business for being 459 sold as and when offers are received by the manufacturer for their purchase. Contracts of sales were finalised in the instant case at Delhi and specific goods were manufactured at Faridabad in pursuance of those contracts. Those were \"future goods\" within the meaning of section 2(6) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. After the goods were manufactured to agreed specifications, they were despatched to the head office at Delhi for being forwarded to the respective customers at whose instance and pursuant to the contracts with whom the goods were manufactured. The goods could as well have been despatched to the respective customers directly from the factory but they were sent in the first instance to Delhi as a matter of convenience, since there are better godown and rail facilities at Delhi as compared with Faridabad. The despatch of the goods of Delhi was but a convenient mode of securing the performance of contracts made at Delhi. Goods conforming to agreed specifications having been manufactured at Faridabad, the contracts of sale could be performed by respondent 1 only by the movement of the goods from Faridabad with the intention of delivering them to the purchasers. Thus, the movement of goods was occasioned from Faridabad to Delhi as a result or incident of the contracts of sale made in Delhi. \n It is true that in the instant case the contracts of sales did not require or provide that goods should be moved from Faridabad to Delhi. But it is not true to say that for the purposes of section 3(a) of the Act it is necessary that the contract of sale must itself provide for and cause the movement of goods or that the movement of goods must be occasioned specifically in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale. The true position in law is as stated in Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd., Bombay v. S. R. Sarkar and others(1) wherein Shah, J. speaking for the majority observed that clauses (a) and (b) of section 3 of the Act are mutually exclusive and that section 3(a) covers sales in which the movement of goods from one State to another \"is the result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale, and property in the goods passes in either State\" \n(page 391). Sarkar, J. speaking for himself and on behalf of Das Gupta, J. agreed with the majority that clauses (a) and (b) of section 3 are mutually exclusive but differed from it and held that \"a sale can occasion the movement of the goods sold only when the terms of the sale provide that the goods would be moved; in other words, a sale occasions a movement of goods when the contract of sale so provides\" (page 407). \nThe view of the majority was approved by this Court in the Central 460 Marketing Co. of India v. State of Mysore,(1) State Trading Corporation of India v. State of Mysore(2) and Singareni Collieries Co. v. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Hyderabad.(3) In K. G. Khosla & Co. v. Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes,(4) counsel for the Revenue invited the Court to reconsider the question but the Court declined to do so. In a recent decision of this Court in Oil India Ltd.\nv. The Superintendent of Taxes & others(5) it was observed by Mathew, J., who spoke for the Court, that: (1) a sale which occasions movement of goods from one State to another is a sale in the course of inter-State trade, no matter in which State the property in the goods passes; (2) it is not necessary that the sale must precede the inter-State movement in order that the sale may be deemed to have occasioned such movement; and (3) it is also not necessary for a sale to be deemed to have taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, that the covenant regarding inter-State Movement must be specified in the contract itself. It would be enough if the movement was in pursuance of and incidental to the contract of sale (page 801). The learned Judge added that it was held in a number of cases by the Supreme Court that if the movement of goods from one State to another is the result of a covenant or an incident of the contract of sale, then the sale is an inter-State sale. \n The decision in Tata Engineering & Locomotive Co.\nLimited v. The Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and Another(6) on which the Union of India relies, proceeds on a different consideration and is distinguishable. The appellant therein carried on the business of manufacturing trucks in Jamshedpur in the State of Bihar. The sales office of the appellant in Bombay used to instruct the Jamshedpur factory to transfer stocks of vehicles to the stockyards in various States after taking into account the production schedule and requirements of customers in different States. \nThe stocks available in the stockyards were distributed from time to time to dealers. The transfer of the vehicles from the factory to the various stockyards was a continuous process and was not related to the requirement of any particular customer. It was the stockyard incharge who appropriated the required number of vehicles to the contract of sale out of the stocks available with him. Until such appropriation of vehicles was made, it was open 461 to the company to allot any vehicle to any purchaser or to transfer the vehicles from the stockyard in one State to a stockyard in another State. At page 870 of the report, a statement occurs in the judgment of Grover, J., that it was not possible to comprehend how in the above situation it could be held that \"the movement of the vehicles from the works to the stockyards was occasioned by any covenant or incident of the contract of sale.\" This statement is relied upon by the Union of India in support of its contention that the contract of sale must itself provide for the movement of goods from one State to another. We are unable to read any such implication in the observation cited above. At page 866 of the report, after referring to certain decisions, the Court observed that the principle admits of no doubt, according to the decisions of this Court, that the movement of goods \"must be the result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale.\" This decision may be usefully contrasted with another decision between the same parties, which is reported in State of Bihar & Anr. v. Tata Engineering & Locomotive Co.\nLtd.(1). In that case the turnover in dispute related to the sales made by the company to its dealers of trucks for being sold in the territories assigned to them under the dealership agreements. Each dealer was assigned an exclusive territory and under the agreement between the dealers and the company, they had to place their indents, pay the price of the goods to be purchased and obtain delivery orders from the Bombay office of the company. In pursuance of such delivery orders trucks used to be delivered in the State of Bihar to be taken over to the territories assigned to the dealers. Since under the terms of the contracts of sale the purchasers were required to remove the goods from the State of Bihar to other States, no question arose in the case whether it was or was not necessary for a sale to be regarded as an inter-State sale that the contract must itself provide for the movement of goods from one State to another. If a contract of sale contains a stipulation for such movement, the sale would, of course, be an inter-State sale. But it an also be an inter-State sale, even if the contract of sale does not itself provide for the movement of goods from one State to another but such movement is the result of a covenant in the contract of sale or is an incident of that contract. The decisions to which we have referred above show that in order that a sale may be regarded as an inter-State sale, it is immaterial whether the property in the goods passes in one State or another. The question as regards the nature of the sale, that is, whether it is an inter- 462 State sale or an intra-State sale, does not depend upon the circumstances as to in which State the property in the goods passes. It may pass in either State and yet the sale can be an inter-State sale. \n The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that the sales in question are inter-State sales and that the turnover of sales is assessable to sales tax under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 at the instance of the Sales Tax authorities at Faridabad. The amount of tax which respondent has wrongly paid to the Sales Tax authorities at Delhi on such inter-State sales from 1-4-1961 to 30-9-1965 shall have to be transferred by the Sales Tax authorities at Delhi to the Sales Tax authorities at Faridabad, as directed by the High Court. \n The appeal is accordingly dismissed but there will be no order as to costs. \n N.K.A                                       Appeal dismissed.",

CORAM : - HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE A.K. SIKRI HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE M.L. MEHTA 1.       Whether Reporters of Local newspapers may be allowed to see the Judgment? 2.       To be referred to the Reporter or not? 3.       Whether the Judgment should be reported in the Digest? A.K. SIKRI, J. (ORAL) 1.      These appeals are filed challenging the orders of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as „the Tribunal‟) under         Wealth       Tax    proceedings      granting      the respondent/assessee benefit of Section 2(ea) of the Wealth Tax Act, 1957 holding that since the property in question held by the assessee is use for business purposes, it would be exempt from the wealth tax. \n 2.      The assessee had been allocated land in question at Plot No.14/6, Site-IV, Sahibabad Industrial Area, Ghaziabad on 99 years lease by Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Corporation for its business. The Wealth Tax Officer denied the exemption under the aforesaid provision and subjected the property to Wealth Tax on the ground that the assessee was not doing any business therefrom for last number of years. The contention of the assessee that it had been doing business and had done job work, which was not accepted by the Wealth Tax Officer. 3.      The CIT (A) took note of the details of job work furnished by the respondent/assessee. However, he was of the view that this claim of the assessee that the assessee had done job work did not repose any confidence in absence of requisite details and there was no proof submitted by the assessee that it had done some job work. The CIT (A) even called upon the AO to look into the issue of reopening of the income tax proceedings to disallow depreciation, as according to him, no commercial activities were carried out by the assessee. \n 4.      The Tribunal has, as noticed above, accepted the appeal of the assessee holding that the assessee had been doing the business in the form of aforesaid job work and therefore, the property in question would be exempt from the Wealth Tax, as per Section 2(ea) of the Wealth Tax Act, which defines “asset” and specifically excludes the asset occupied by the assessee for the purpose of any business or profession carried on by him. \n 5.      The Tribunal took note of a very crucial fact, viz., for the Assessment Years 2001-02 to 2006-07, the assessee had filed income tax returns in which the assessee had shown business income.       It had also claimed depreciation on the aforesaid building constructed by the assessee on the leasehold land in question and this depreciation was allowed by the AO in all these years. The Tribunal further found that though no regular assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act for the Assessment Years 2001-02 to 2004-05 had been made by the AO and in those Assessment Years, the assessment was completed under Section 143(1) of the Act, insofar as the Assessment Years 2005-06 to 2006-07 are concerned, the case of the assessee for these years was selected for scrutiny          and regular assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act had been made wherein the assessee‟s claim of depreciation on the building @10% on Written Down Value had been allowed. As mentioned above, in these Assessment Years, the assessee had shown income under the head “Profits & Gains of Business or Profession”, which was also accepted by the AO. Even when the CIT (A) while discussing the case of the assessee under the Wealth Tax Act had opined that the case of the assessee under Income Tax Act be reopened, no such steps were taken by the AO under the provisions of the Act which shows that the assessments under the Act had become final.       This fact was specifically taken note of by the Tribunal. \n 6.      From the aforesaid narration, it is clear that not only in the Assessment Years in question, the assessee had carried on its business utilizing the aforesaid asset for this purpose, but this decision was even accepted by the Department as well. \n 7.      In these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the order of the Tribunal is without blemish. We are, thus, of the view that no substantial question of law arises.      These appeals are accordingly dismissed. (A.K. SIKRI) JUDGE (M.L. MEHTA) JUDGE JULY 18, 2011 pmc",

We have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Additional State Public Prosecutor. We have carefully re -looked into the materials on record. \n 3. The brief factual matrix of the case are that the complainant by name Kashinath (PW.1), is the elder uncle of the accused. The accused and deceased Basamma are the husband and wife and they were all residing in a village called as Jozna, in Aurad Taluk of Bidar District. There is no dispute with regard to the relationship between the accused and the deceased. After the marriage, they lived together is also not in dispute. It is the allegation that the accused is a vagabond and he often demanding money with his wife and others. Due to the wedlock, they also gave birth to a male child. The wife of the accused (the deceased Basamma), along with her mother-in-law i.e., mother of the accused, were also residing in the same house and they were all eaking their livelihood by doing coolie. The accused was not caring his wife, mother and child. In this context, it appears that there were some small aberrations and contusions in the family between the husband and the wife, due to which there was some strained relationship. The deceased was scared of the accused always. 4. In this background, it is alleged that on 10.02.2007, the accused had come to Jozna Village and after receiving the information about the same, the deceased Basamma, and mother of the accused went to their relatives house i.e., the house of P.W.11  Sharanappa and slept in his house, due to fear of the accused. It is further case of the prosecution that, they came to the house at 8.00 a.m. on 11.02.2008, and the accused picked-up quarrel in his house in presence of his mother by demanding money and he expressed that he wanted to sell the house property, due to which, the wife has quarreled with the accused. In this context, it is alleged that, the accused dragged her inside the room and mercilessly assaulted on her head with a mussal (Vanake) and also assaulted her with knife and caused severe injuries, on all the parts of the body including the vital parts of the body like head and chest etc. Due to the injuries sustained by her, she succumbed to the injuries on the spot itself. This was seen by the mother of the accused and neighbourers by name, Sharnappa, Rachappa, Taramma, Shivsharnappa and others etc. P.W.1 who is none other than the elder uncle of the accused was also present at the time of incident, lodged a complaint as per Ex.P.1. The Police Sub Inspector  P.W.23 has registered a case in Crime No.12/2007 on 11.02.2007, itself and dispatched the first information report to the jurisdictional Magistrate. P.W.21 took over the further investigation and conducted the detailed investigation and laid a charge sheet against the accused for the offences punishable under Sections 302 and 504 of Indian Penal Code. The accused was also arrested and he was produced before the Court and remanded. The trial Court framed the charges for the offences punishable under Sections 302 and 504 of Indian Penal Code, as the accused pleaded not guilty, he was put on the trial by the trial Court. \n 5. The prosecution in order to prove the guilt of the accused, examined twenty three witnesses as P.Ws.1 to 23 and marked documents Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-37 and material objects at M.O.Nos.1 to 10. The accused was also examined by the Court under Section 313 of Criminal Procedure Code. \nIt appears from the statement of the accused and the cross examination of witnesses, the accused has not taken any special defence as such except denial of the entire prosecution case. The Court after hearing the arguments looking to the oral and documentary evidence, with all certainty, came to the conclusion that the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts for the offence punishable under Section 302 of Indian Penal Code but not under Section 504 of Indian Penal Code. \nConsequently, the trial Court has acquitted the accused for the offence under Section 504 of Indian Penal Code. \nHowever, convicted the accused for the offence under Section 302 of Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to undergo life imprisonment as noted above. \n 6. On overall re-appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence on record and also after going through the judgment of the trial Court and the grounds urged before this Court, the only point that would arise for our consideration is that :- \"Whether the appellant/accused has made out any reasonable or substantive ground in any manner to interfere with the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court ?\" \n 7. In order to answer the above point, it is just and necessary that, we have to closely look at the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. P.W.1 is the complainant, who is none other than the elder uncle of the accused, who lodged the complaint as per Ex.P.1 and he is also to some extent an eye witness to the incident and also circumstantial witness, to the fact that, the accused ran away from the place of incident with a blood stained knife. P.W.2 is the inquest panch witness attested Ex.P.19 and also attested Ex.P.20, under which one knife, shirt and a pant, were recovered at the instance of the accused. P.Ws.2 and 14 are the panch witnesses to Ex.P.21 under which the photographs, as per Exs.P.2 to P.18, were seized by the police. P.W.4 is the another panch witness to Ex.P.23, under which the police have seized a blood stained mussal (Vanake) as per M.O.No.1 and blood stained mud and unstained mud as per M.O.Nos.8 and 9. P.W.5 is the another seizure panch to M.O.Nos.5 to 7 under Ex.P.24, which are the blood stained cloths of the deceased. P.Ws.6 to 8, 10 and 11 are the eye witnesses to the incident and they are none other than the relatives and neighbors of the accused. P.W.9 is the panch witness for seizure of some more photographs under Ex.P.26 along with negatives. P.W.12 is the father of the deceased who is also a circumstantial witness. P.W.13 is the person who actually seen the accused running away from the spot wearing the blood stained cloths and a knife and also a witness to extra judicial confession. P.W.15 is a police personnel, who carried the incriminating articles to Forensic Science Laboratory. P.W.16 is the police person who apprehended the accused on 11.02.2007. P.W.17 is the Tahsildar who conducted the inquest proceedings as per Ex.P.19. P.W.18 is a police person who shifted the dead body of the deceased to the hospital after inquest and after the post mortem examination, produced the cloths of the deceased before the Investigating Officer, for seizure as per M.O.Nos.5 to 7. P.W.19 is the Doctor who conducted the autopsy on the dead body of deceased Basamma, as per Ex.P.28. During the course of the investigation, after recovery of knife and mussal (Vanake), the Investigating Officer has also sought for opinion about those articles and P.W.19 has also given opinion as per Ex.P.29. P.W.20 is the police person who registered a case against the accused earlier to the incident, in Crime No.61/05, under Section 96-B of Karnataka Police Act. P.W.22 is a Junior Engineer, who drew-up a spot sketch as per Ex.P.32. P.W.23 is the person who received the complaint and registered a case against the accused in Crime No.12/2007 and dispatched the first information report to the jurisdictional Magistrate. \n 8. On careful cursory reading of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the entire case revolves around two aspects, one is the version of the eye witnesses and another is the recovery of the incriminating articles at the instance of the accused and its connection with the crime alleged to have been committed by the accused. \n 9. In this background, we would like to discuss the evidence of eye witness P.W.1. In this regard, we have already noted that he is none other than the elder uncle of accused. P.W.6  Shivasharanaiah, who is the eye witness as well as a neighbour. P.W.7 is also neighbour of the accused, whose houses are situated near the house of accused. \nP.W.10  Gangamma is the mother of the deceased and she also supported the case of the prosecution but to some extent she turned hostile. However, she corroborated the evidence of the other eye witnesses. P.W.13 is the person who has seen the accused with blood stained cloths who ran way immediately after the incident. 10. On careful perusal of evidence of these eye witnesses, they have categorically deposed by implicating the accused to the crime. They have stated that on the day of the incident, all of them were present in the house of the accused, they came to the house of accused, after hearing the quarreling sound of the accused and the deceased. \nP.W.10Gangamma, mother of the accused and the deceased Basamma, were slept in the house of P.W.11  Sharanappa, on the previous day, that has been fully confirmed by the evidence of P.W.11, who has stated that on the previous day the deceased Basamma and Gangamma slept in his house, even without taking any food. In the morning the deceased Basamma and Gangamma (P.W.10), went to their house and there, accused started quarreling with deceased Basamma and he took her to a room by pulling her hairs and then he mercilessly assaulted her with the help of a mussal (Vanake) and he stabbed her with a knife, mercilessly on the face, chest and other parts of the body and thereby Basamma, sustained severe injuries and fell down on the ground and she died on the spot itself, after sustaining those injuries. Even there was no occasion for any of the witnesses to shift the deceased to the hospital considering the nature of the injuries, which were inflicted by the accused on the deceased, and instantaneous death of the deceased. \n 11. On careful re-evaluation of the cross examination of these witnesses, there is no cross examination adverted to these witnesses except, heir and there, some questions have been put with reference to the conduct of the accused and also the conduct of the deceased and also a quarrel being taken place between the accused and the deceased. Very peculiarly enough the death of the deceased has not been denied, which occurred in the house of the accused, on that particular day and time. The suggestions made to these witnesses by the learned counsel appearing for the accused to the effect that, on that particular day the deceased died due to falling on a stone or a knife or on a vegetable cutter. \nSo, this clarifies the situations that, on that day and time of the incident the said Basamma died in the house by sustaining injuries and the accused was very much present. \nTherefore, it goes without saying that the accused has nothing much to show about the death of the deceased, he is the person who was also present at the time of the death of Basamma. He has not at all stated anything in his 313 statement, as to how the death of the deceased Basamma occurred, though, in the cross examination a different versions have been suggested to the witnesses. Even on looking to the cross examination of these witnesses, there is no denial by the accused that these witnesses were not related to him nor neighbours of the accused. There is no reason suggested during the course of cross examination as to why these witnesses have to falsely implicate the accused to the crime and no any sort of vengeance, is elucidated during the course of evidence of these witnesses so as to even suspect the evidence of these witnesses. \n 12. Though we have observed certain improvements by these witnesses during the course of their examination in chief that, some of the witnesses who have actually came to the house of the accused, little later they have only seen the accused running away from the spot with blood stained knife. \nBut during the course of evidence, they have stated that they have actually seen the incident, particularly the mother of the accused and also P.W.11  Sharanappa and also P.W.1  Kashinath, they have made certain improvements in their deposition before the Court. But it is well recognized principle of law that, whatever the witness say before the Court is a substantive evidence and whatever they have stated during the course of investigation in their 161 statement or the complaints, themselves will not become substantive evidence. Therefore, if there is any improvement made by the witnesses that portion should have been tackled during the course of cross examination by the learned counsel for the accused so as to prove such improvement and also to request the Court not to rely upon such improvement, but no suggestion even have been made to these witnesses that these witnesses have not stated so during the course of investigation. Therefore, what the witnesses have stated before the Court in their deposition has to be accepted by the Court unless it is contraverted or disproved, during the course of cross examination. \n 13. Therefore, looking to the above said evidence of all these witnesses, who are the neighbours and kith and kin of the accused, there is absolutely no reason to disbelieve them. The photographs marked before the Court at Exs.P.2 to P.18, which are the photographs of the deceased, taken immediately perhaps at the time of inquest proceedings clearly discloses the merciless assault on the deceased by the accused. Further added to that, the evidence of the Doctor  P.W.19 also clarified the situation that the deceased died due to the injuries sustained by her. The post mortem report also discloses the deceased sustained as many as fourteen injuries including the injuries on the vital parts of the body. \nThe Doctor has ultimately opined that the cause of death was due to intra cranial hemorrhage, due to fracture skull, due to coming in contact with blunt object. Therefore, there is no much dispute as we have narrated with regard to the homicidal death of the deceased as it is suggested during the course of cross examination of witnesses that she died on the date, place and time. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the trial Court has not committed any serious error in appreciating the oral and documentary evidence on record so far as the eye witnesses are concerned. \n 14. The prosecution has also relied upon the recovery of some incriminating articles at the instance of the accused. \nThe evidence of P.W.2, is relevant in this regard. He has stated that at the instance of the accused, the Investigating Officer has recovered M.O.Nos.2 to 4, they are a pant, shirt and a knife under Ex.P.20. It is also in the evidence of P.W.18, who shifted the dead body of the deceased, that he collected the cloths of the deceased as per M.O.Nos.5 to 7, after the post mortem examination and produced them before the Investigating Officer and they were seized by the Investigating Officer in presence of P.W.5 under Ex.P.24. In the course of cross examination of these witnesses, nothing has been elicited so as to discard their evidence. Therefore, the prosecution has also proved the seizure and recovery of these articles from the spot and as well as from the accused. These materials i.e., M.O.No.1  mussal (Vanake) and M.O.Nos.8 and 9, blood stained mud and unstained mud, seized at the spot and also M.O.Nos.2 to 4, which are the cloths and knife at the instance of the accused and as well as the M.O.Nos.5 to 7, which are the blood stained cloths of the deceased, were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory and secured the report. The Forensic Science Laboratory report is marked as Ex.P.34, also clearly discloses that the chemical examination report shows that the blood stains of the deceased which is `O' group tallied with the blood stains, found on the weapons used i.e., one mussal M.O.No.1 and knife M.O.No.2 and also the blood stained cloths of the accused i.e., Mo.Nos.3 and 4. In this context also the accused during the course of his examination or during the course of cross examination of these witnesses, not explained as to how his cloths contained the blood stains of the deceased. Therefore, the prosecution has also established this recovery and also connection of the material objects i.e., knife and a Mussal (Vanake), being used by the accused for commission of the crime. 15. Under the above said facts and circumstances, even after re-appreciation of the above said evidence, we do not find any strong reasons to interfere with the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court. Hence, the appeal is devoid of merits and the same is liable to be dismissed. Accordingly, we answered the point formulated by us in the `negative' and proceed to pass the following :- ORDER The appeal is dismissed. \n         The judgment of conviction and sentence passed in S.C.No.71/2007, dated 17.03.2010, by the Presiding Officer, FTC-I, at Bidar, is hereby confirmed. \n Sd/- JUDGE Sd/- JUDGE sn",

The subject matter of I.T.A.No.415/2011 pertains to Assessment Year 2004-05, whereas, the subject matter of I.T.A.No.407/2011 pertains to the Assessment year 2005-06. Since, common substantial questions of law arise for consideration in these appeals, they were heard analogously and are being decided by this common judgment. The appeals were admitted by a bench of this Court vide order dated 17.09.2012 on the following substantial questions of law: (i) Whether the appellate authorities were correct in holding that the Assessing Officer had no locus standi to examine the activities of the assessee trust in order to find out whether they were carrying charitable activity as the assessee had already been granted exemption under Section 11 of the Act?\n (ii) Whether the Tribunal was correct in holding that the provisions for doubtful debts of Rs.1,98,818/- should be allowed as a expenditure even though the same is not written off and the same is continued as a provision in the assessee's books? \n (iii) whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the re-opening of assessment under Section 147 of the Act is justified when the time limit for initiation of regular assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act has not expired? 2. For the facility of reference, facts from I.T.A.No.415/2011 are being referred to. Facts leading to filing of these appeals briefly stated are that the assessee is a Trust and has been incorporated with an object to provide educational, medical relief to the poor and to provide services of general public utility. For the Assessment Year 2004-05, the assessee filed the return of income on 31.03.2006, by which total expenditure of Rs.23,46,79,122/- was shown over income. The assessee claimed a sum of Rs.17,04,250/- being a provision for bad and doubtful debts. The assessment was re-opened under Section 147 of the Act by issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act dated 31.01.2007, which was served on the assessee on 02.02.2007. The assessee by a communication dated 28.02.2007, requested return of income filed on 31.03.2006 as response to notice under Section 148 of the Act. The Assessing Officer by an order dated 31.12.2007 inter alia held that free food, which was claimed to have been distributed to the weaker section of public in general by the assessee was not substantiated by producing any evidence. It was further held that the assessee distributed `Prasada' to the visitors who belonged to middle class and the donations, which were collected were not expended for the purposes of which the Trust was incorporated. It was further held that sum of Rs.13,26,099/- was paid to Jadu Works Private Limited, which was shown as a provision and the same cannot be treated as provision for bad and doubtful debts. Accordingly, the Assessing Officer completed the assessment and levied tax and penalty. The assessee thereupon filed an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) by an order dated 19.01.2009 inter alia held that the activities carried on by the assessee were charitable in nature and bad debts were found to be allowable deduction as the party to whom the amount was advanced was not traceable. Thereupon the assessee approached the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'the Tribunal' for short). The Tribunal by an order 13.05.2011 inter alia held that the Assessing Officer had no locus standi to examine the activities carried on by the Trust while passing an order of assessment and once an order of exemption has been passed under Section 11 of the Act, the Assessing Officer is bound by the same. It was further held that provision for bad and doubtful debt is a necessary charge as per accounting principle and even if Section 11 of the Act is not applicable, the same has to be allowed. Accordingly, the Tribunal allowed the appeal preferred by the assessee. In the aforesaid factual background, these appeals have been filed. \n 3. Learned counsel for the revenue submitted that order of re-opening of the assessment was justified and additional substantial question of law cannot be examined at the instance of the assessee. It is argued that the Assessing Officer has examined the issue whether the assessee has incurred expenditure to achieve objects of the trust and therefore, the Tribunal erred in holding that the Assessing Officer had no locus to examine the activities of the Trust. It is also submitted that burden was on the assessee to prove the fact that the expenses incurred were towards object of the trust and the assessee has failed to discharge the same. It is also pointed out that the Tribunal has proceeded on erroneous assumption that the assessee has questioned the objects of the Trust. It is also argued that the Tribunal ought to have appreciated that purpose of making an advance to a party has to be made in the course of business and then only the assessee is entitled to write off the same as expenditure as provision for bad and doubtful debt. In the instant case, the assessee has failed to demonstrate that the amount paid to Jadu Works Private Limited was made in course of business. In support of his submissions, reliance has been placed on decision of the Supreme Court in 'VIJAYA BANK VS. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX AND ANOTHER', (2010) 323 ITR 166 (SC). \n 4. On the other hand, learned counsel for the assesses submitted that prior to amendment of Section 153 by Finance Act, 2005 which came into force with effect from 01.04.2006, the aforesaid provision mandated that no order of assessment shall be made under Section 143 or Section 144 at any time after expiry of two years from the end of Assessment Year, in which income was first assessable. It is further submitted that the amendment incorporated by Finance Act, 2005 with effect from 01.04.2006 is not applicable to the fat situation of the case as the Assessment Years in question are 2004-05 and 2005-06. It is further submitted that the Finance Act, 2005 by which proviso has been inserted in Section 153 is prospective in nature. It is also argued that notice under Section 148(1) of the Act was issued on 31.01.2007 by taking recourse to Section 143(2) of the Act and without completing the assessment, notice under Section 148 cannot be issued. It is pointed out that the assessee had filed the return on 31.03.2006 and within 12 months, notice under Section 143(2) could be issued i.e., upto 31.03.2007 and the assessment had to be completed under Section 143(3) of the Act before 31.12.2006 as required under Section 153 of the Act. However, notice was issued under Section 148 of the Act on 31.03.2007 without completion of the proceeding pending on the basis of the return, which was already filed and therefore, the notice issued under Section 148(1) on 31.03.2007 is per se without jurisdiction. \n 5. It is further submitted that assessee had given donation to another Trust having similar objects and in this regard, additional documents were filed before Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and the remand report from the Assessing Officer was called for.\n However, in the remand report, Assessing Officer did not offer any comments to the additional documents produced by the assessee. It is also argued that even if benefit is given to a section of the society, the object of charity is fulfilled and depreciation has to be allowed to the assessee viz., a Charitable Trust also, as expenditure on acquisition of assets, which has to be computed in commercial manner even though, the Trust may not be carrying on any business. In this regard, our attention has also been invited to the Circular issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes dated 19.06.1968. In support of aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decisions in `TRUSTEES OF H.E.H. THE NIZAM'S SUPPLEMENTAL FAMILY TRUST VS.\nCOMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX', (2000) 3 SCC 501, ` COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX VS.\nJ.K.CHARITABLE TRUST', (1992) 196 ITR 31 (ALL), `ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX VS.\nTHANTHI TRUST', (2001) 247 ITR 785 (SC), `AHMEDABAD RANA CASTE ASSOCIATION VS.\nCOMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, GUJARAT', (1971) 82 ITR 704 (SC), `COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX-III, PUNE VS. RAJASTHANI AND GUJARATI CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, POONA', (2018) 7 SCC 810, `CIRCULAR NO.5-P(LXX-6) OF 1968, DATED 19.06.1968, `COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, KARNATAKA-I VS. SOCIETY OF THE SISTERS OF ST.ANNE', (1984) 146 ITR 28 (KAR), and `K.P.VARGHESE VS. INCOME-TAX OFFICER, ERNAKULAM AND ANOTHER', (1981) 131 ITR 597 (SC). \n 6. We have considered the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record. Admittedly, the assessee is a charitable institution registered under Section 12A of the Act. The Supreme Court in `COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX VS. ANDHRA CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE', (1965) 55 ITR 722 held that an object beneficial to a section of public is an object of general public utility. It has further been held that in order to serve a charitable purpose, it is not necessary that the object should be to the benefit of whole of mankind or all the persons in particular country or state and it is sufficient, if the intention is to benefit a section of the public as distinguished from a specified individual is present. The aforesaid view was reiterated with approval in AHMEDABAD RANA CASTE ASSOCIATION supra. On the touchstone of aforesaid well settled legal position, even if the order of the Assessing Officer is seen, it can be deciphered from para 7 of the order that `prasadam' has been distributed to the visitors. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) in paragraph 5.2 has held that the Assessing Officer has ignored the submission made by the assessee that the assessee provides free meals to the general public on every Sunday morning in free distribution hall and therefore, the finding recorded by the Assessing Officer that assessee has not carried any charitable activity is perverse. The aforesaid finding has also been affirmed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal by holding that all the pilgrims who visit ISKON Temple are served with `Prasadam' without probing into their caste, creed, religion and nationality. Thus, the expenditure has definitely been incurred on a section of the society and therefore, the same would tantamount to a charitable purpose. The aforesaid concurrent findings of fact have been recorded by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) as well as Income Tax Appellate Tribunal on the basis of meticulous appreciation of evidence on record. No perversity could be pointed out in the aforesaid concurrent findings of fact. Therefore, in the fact situation of the case, the first substantial question of law in fact, does not arise for consideration as the assessee was carrying on charitable activity. \n 7. It is well settled in law that income of the trust has to be computed in a normal commercial manner and only the real income has to be taken into account. The loss of sale of investment is not allowable in computing the income for the purposes of Section 11 of the Act. [See: `COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX- III vs. RAJASTHANI AND GUJARATI CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, POONA supra]. In the context of the aforesaid well settled legal principle, the second substantial question of law may be examined. It is pertinent to note that the Assessing Officer during the course of assessment did not ask for any document from the assessee for making the advance. The assessee before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) had filed an application under Rule 46A of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 on 25.02.2008. The aforesaid paper was forwarded to the Assessing Officer. The Assessing Officer submitted a remand report, however, the Assessing Officer did not offer any comment with regard to additional evidence adduced by the assessee before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). The purchase of immovable properties for the purposes of objects of the Trust is the application of income and even if the assessee has earned income from selling the land for achieving objects of the Trust, the same would be allowable under Section 11 of the Act. The Tribunal has also held that as per prevalent accounting principles which clearly lay down that loss on sale of investment should be taken into account while determining the commercial income, the assessee is entitled to expenditure in respect of provision for doubtful debt. Accordingly, the aforesaid substantial question of law is answered against the revenue and in favour of assessee. \n The concurrent findings of fact on both the substantial questions of law have been recorded by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) as well as Income Tax Appellate Tribunal on the basis of meticulous appreciation of evidence on record. No perversity could be pointed out in the aforesaid concurrent findings of fact. It is well settled in law that until and unless perversity is pointed out in the concurrent findings of fact, this court in exercise of powers under Section 260A of the Act cannot interfere with the concurrent findings of fact. \n In view of our answer to the common questions of law involved in both the appeals, it is not necessary to answer the additional substantial question of law. In the result, we do not find any merit in these appeals. The same fail and are hereby dismissed  Sd/- JUDGE Sd/- JUDGE ss",

(1962) 44 I.T.R. 714, distinguished. \n\nJUDGMENT:          CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 2366 of 1972. \n         From the Judgment and order dated 25-3-1971 of the Calcutta High Court in Income Tax Ref. No. 120/69. V. S. Deasi, S. R. Agarwal, Anil Sachthey, Praveen Kumar and Miss Bina Gupta for the Appellant. T. A.\nRamachandran and Miss A. Subhashini for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATHAK, J: This appeal by certificate under section 66- A(2) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 raises a question involving the interpretation of section 24(2) (iii) of that Act. The assessee is a company carrying on the business of manufacturing jute goods. The case relates to the assessment year 1960-61, for which the relevant accounting period is the financial year ending Match 31, 1960. While making the assessment for the assessment year 1959-60, the Income Tax officer set off the unabsorbed business loss of Rs. 1,58,845 for 1949-50 and Rs. 5,70,952 for 1950-51 against the business income of that year and directed that Rs. 15,50,189 representing the loss remaining unabsorbed should be carried forward. In the assessment proceeding for the assessment year 1960-61, with which we are concerned, the assessee claimed that the unabsorbed loss should be carried forward and set off against the business income of the current year. The Income Tax officer rejected the claim on the ground that the unabsorbed loss related to 1950-51 and could not be carried forward for more than eight years. The assessee pressed the claim in appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner but without success. A second appeal was dismissed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. At the instance of the assessee, the Appellate 908 Tribunal referred the following question of law to the High Court at Calcutta:- \"Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case, the assessee was entitled in law to set off unabsorbed loss of Rs. 15,50,189 of the assessment year 1950-51 against the business income of the assessment year 1960-61 ?\" \nThe High Court answered the question in the negative. In this appeal by the assessee it is contended that by virtue of section 24(2) (iii) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, as it stood before its amendment with effect from April 1, 1957, the assessee had acquired a vested right to have the unabsorbed loss carried forward from year to year until it was completely set off and the subsequent amendment limiting the period for carrying forward the loss to eight years could not divest the assessee of the vested right which had thus accrued to him. It is pointed out that the amendment effected in 1957 is not retrospective in operation . In our judgment, there is no substance in the assesse's claim. \n         Section 24(2) has suffered amendment a number of times. \nPrior to its amendment by the Finance Act, 1955 it permitted a business loss to be carried forward for not more than six years, except in the case of losses pertaining to certain assessment years ending with the assessment year 1943-44 where the period for carrying forward was shorter. Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1955 amended section 24(2), and as a result of the amendment section 24(2) (iii) provided that a businesss loss which was not wholly set off could be carried forward from year to year. Thereafter, Finance (No. 2) Act of 1957 amended s.24(2) (iii) with effect from April 1, 1957 and in consequence an unabsorbed loss could not now be carried forward for more than eight years. \n         The assessee claims a vested right under section 24(2) (iii), as it, stood before its amendment in 1957, to have the unabsorbed loss of 1950-51 carried forward from year to year until the loss is completely absorbed. The claim is based on a misconception of the fundamental basis underlying every income tax assessment. \"It is a cardinal principle of the tax law that the law to be applied is that in force in the assessment year unless otherwise provided expressly or by necessary implication.\" Commissioner of Income-Tax West Bengal v. Isthmian Steamship Lines and Karimtharuvi Tea Estate Ltd. v. State of Kerala on that principle, it is abundantly clear that when an 909 assessment for the assessment year 1960-61 is to be made and section 24(2) is invoked, it is s.24(2) as in force in that assessment year which has to be applied.' That is the provision as amended by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1957. There is no question of the assessee possessing any vested right under the law as it stood before the amendment. The assessment for one assessment year cannot, in the absence of a contrary provision, be affected by the law in force in another assessment year. A right claimed by an assessee under the law in force in a particular assessment year is ordinarily available only in relation to a proceeding pertaining to that year. Therefore, inasmuch as the provisions of section 24(2), as amended in 1957, govern the assessment for the assessment year 1960-61, the High Court is right in affirming that the unabsorbed loss of Rs.\n15,50,189 of the assessment year 1950-Sl cannot be carried forward for more than eight years, and consequently cannot be set off against the business income of the assessment year 1960-61. \n It is pointed out that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner mentioned in his order for the assessment year 1959-60 that the unabsorbed loss of Rs. 15,50,189 should be carried forward. That direction has meaning only if the law in force in the assessment year 1960-61 permits the unabsorbed loss to be carried forward into the assessment of that year. The direction by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner assumes that it the law permits the unabsorbed loss to be carried forward into future years, but as we have seen that is not the law and, therefore, the assessee can derive no advantage from that direction. \n The assessee relies on the judgment of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax Kerala v. Helen Rubber Industries Ltd.(l) That was a case, however, where paragraph 3 of the Taxation Laws (Removal of Difficulties) order, 1950 operated to divide the previous years to which the provision of the Travancore Income Tax Act, 1946 applied from those previous years to which the provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, brought into force in the State of Travancore in 1950, would apply. It was because of the Removal of Difficulties order that the Court held that since under the Travancore Law the loss could be carried forward for two years only and those two years ended be- fore the previous years for which the Indian Income Tax Act began to apply, the benefit of the period of six years under the Indian Income Tax Act would not be available. The case is clearly distinguishable. \n In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed. \n P.B.R.                                     Appeal dismissed.",

Mr.P.J.Pardiwala, Advocate for petitioners. Mr.R.Ashokan for respondents. CORAM : F.I.REBELLO AND\n                                J.P.DEVADHAR, JJ.\n\n                  DATED: 11TH SEPTEMBER, 2007. ORAL JUDGMENT (PER J.P.DEVADHAR J.)  1.  In this petition, the challenge is to the order dated 25th February, 1993 passed by the Appropriate Authority under section 269 UD(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (`the Act' for short) whereby `Abhishek Bungalow' situated at 4 Bungalows, Off Linking Road, Andheri (West), Mumbai - 400 058 (`property in question' for short) is sought to be purchased by the Appropriate Authority under Chapter XX-C of the Act.\n 2.  The facts relevant for the purpose of the present petition are that by an agreement dated 5th October, 1989 the petitioners agreed to purchase from the respondent No.5 the property in question for a lumpsum price of Rs.45,00,000/- subject to the tenancy of respondent No.6. On an application made in form No.37-I the Appropriate Authority under the Act passed an order on 28th December, 1989 purporting to purchase the said property without giving any opportunity of hearing to the petitioners. \n 3.  Aggrieved by the said order, the petitioners filed a Writ Petition bearing No.93 of 1990. The said Writ Petition was allowed by this Court on 16th December, 1992 whereby the purchase order dated 28th December, 1989 was quashed and set aside and the matter was remanded with directions to reprocess the application of the petitioners in the light of the Judgment of the Supreme Court in C.B.Gautam V/s. Union of India reported in 199 I.T.R. 530. Thereafter by a show cause notice dated 1/1/1993 the petitioners were called upon to show cause as to why the property in question agreed to be purchased by the petitioners should not be purchased under 269UD (1) of the Act. In the said show cause notice, the Appropriate Authority relied upon four sale instances in the neighbouring JVPD and Juhu localities to establish that the property in question was undervalued by 15% of the fair market value. \n 5.  The petitioners by their reply letter dated 22/1/1993 objected to the purchase of the property under section 269 UD(1) of the Act on various grounds set out therein. In the said reply, the petitioners inter alia stated that even on the basis of sale instances set out in the impugned show cause, it cannot be said that there is undervaluation by 15% of the fair market value. By the said reply, the petitioners called upon the respondents to furnish particulars of the sale instances referred to in the show cause notice. The petitioners also relied upon a sale instance in the same Society wherein similar property has been sold for a lesser price and the sale of that flat has been approved by the Appropriate Authority under Chapter XX-C of the Act. Accordingly, it was submitted that there was no undervaluation and the show cause notice be dropped. \n 6.  By the impugned order dated 25th February, 1993 the Appropriate Authority purported to purchase the property in question. Challenging the said order, the present petition is filed. During the pendency of the Writ Petition, in view of the stay granted by this Court, no further action has been taken to implement the impugned order dated 25th February, 1993. \n 7.  Mr.Pardiwala, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that the impugned order dated 25th February, 1993 suffers from serious infirmities and is liable to be quashed and set aside, because, firstly, the appropriate authority has not determined the fair market value of the property in question so as to arrive at a conclusion that there is any undervaluation to the extent of 15% of the fair market value. Secondly, it is contended that the impugned order passed without furnishing particulars relating to the sale instances set out in the show cause notice, is in breach of the principles of natural justice. Thirdly, it is contended that even if the average sale prices of the sale instances set out in the show cause notice are taken as the fair market value, there is no undervaluation to the extent of 15% as enunciated by the Apex Court in the case of C.B.\nGautam. Fourthly, some of the similar properties situated in the same locality which were purchased by the appropriate authority were put to auction during the relevant period at a price less than the price of the petitioners, but the same could not be sold, which clearly shows that there was no undervaluation of the property in question. Lastly, Mr.Pardiwala submitted that the sale instances pointed out by the petitioners has not been considered by the Appropriate Authority. \nFor all the aforesaid reasons, Mr.Pardiwala submitted that the impugned order is liable to be quashed and set aside. \n 8.  Mr.Ashokan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the revenue submitted that prior to the decision of this Court in the case of Vimal Agarwal V/s. A.A. & Others reported in 210 ITR 16, there was no practice of determining the fair market value. \nMr.Ashokan further submitted that the objections raised by the petitioners have in fact been considered in the impugned order and, therefore, no fault can be found with the said order. Accordingly, Mr.Ashokan submitted that there is no merit in the petition and the same is liable to be dismissed. \n 9.  We have carefully considered the rival submissions. The Apex Court in the case of C.B.Gautam (supra) has held that the provisions of Chapter XX-C can be resorted to only when there is a significant undervaluation to the extent of 15% of the fair market value with a view to evade tax. As held by this Court in the case of Vimal Agarwal (supra) it is necessary to first determine the fair market value of the property in question in the light of the attending circumstances. This Court has further held that without determining the fair market value, it is not only difficult but impossible to say that the apparent consideration is lower than the fair market value by 15%. In the present case, admittedly, the fair market value of the property in question is not determined and, therefore, purchase of the property in question on the footing that there is undervaluation to the extent of 15% of the fair market value has to be held to be without any basis. 10.       It is pertinent to note that the property in question is situated at Versova whereas the sale instances relied upon in the impugned order are situated at Juhu. According to the petitioners, the distance between Versova and Juhu is about 2 to 3 Kms.\n and there is vast difference between the valuation of the property situated in these two localities. This is evident from the fact that even the State Government for the purposes of stamp duty has fixed higher rate in respect of the premises situated at Juhu compared to the rate in respect of the premises situated at Versova. This disparity in the location has not been considered in the impugned order in spite of specific objections was raised by the petitioners in that behalf. \n 11.      Moreover, before passing the impugned order, the appropriate authority has neither given the documents relating to the sale instances referred to in the show cause notice nor in the impugned order, the appropriate authority has referred to the sale instance pointed by the petitioners in their reply to the show cause notice. In these circumstances, the grievance of the petitioners that the impugned order suffers from serious infirmities deserves acceptance. \n 12.  It is pertinent to note that the appropriate authority purported to sell some of the properties situated in the same locality which were purchased by them under section 269 UD(1) of the Act at the price lesser than the price agreed to by the petitioners and in spite of the best attempt the appropriate authority could not sell those properties. This fact is neither denied in the affidavit in reply nor dealt with in the impugned order . Thus, it cannot be said that the sale consideration in respect of the property in question is undervalued. \n 13.  For all the aforesaid reasons, we are of the opinion, that the impugned order cannot be sustained. \n 14.   Accordingly, the petition is allowed. Rule is made absolute, however, with no order as to costs. \n (F.I.REBELL0, J.) (J.P.DEVADHAR, J.)",

It did not have any\nstockyard in the State but maintained such stockyards in\ndifferent States for the purpose of effective distribution of\nvehicles among its dealers. A form of agreement between the\nappellant and its dealers provided that the company agreed to\nsell and supply from its Works at Jamshedpur or from its\nstockyards outside the State vehicles to the dealer which\nwould be allotted to the dealer by the Company at its\ndiscretion. In another provision it was laid down that by\nthe 15th of each month the dealer shall mail to the company\nhis statements containing firm orders for purchases to be\neffected during the next succeeding month. \nIn the course of its assessment to sales tax 'for the years'\n1964-65 and 1965-66, the appellant claimed that as the demand\nfor the vehicles far exceeded the production, no firm orders\nas envisaged in the dealership agreement had in fact been\n 'received . The actual procedure followed by the appellant\nwas that the sales office of the appellant in Bombay, after\ntaking into account the production schedule and requirements\nin different States, instructed the factory to transfer\nstocks of vehicles to the stockyards in the various States by\n\nStock Transfer Authorisations in which the model of the\nchassis and the number of units were mentioned. The stocks\navailable in the stockyards were distributed from time to\ntime to dealers taking care to ensure that the over-all\nsupply to the dealers in any State was in proportion to the\nnumber of orders pending with the dealer on May 1, 1963 or on\nthe basis of the off-take by the dealer during the year\nending September 30, 1962 as required by the Commercial\nVehicles (Distribution and Sale) Control Order, 1963. For\nthis purpose allotments were made to the dealer for each\nmonth by an allocation letter by the sales office. it was\n claimed that the transfer of the vehicles from the factory to\nthe various stockyards was a continuous process and was not\nrelated to the requirement of any particular customer; that\nthere was no connection between the Stock Transfer\nAuthorisation and the allocation letter. It was the stock-\nyard incharge who appropriated the required number of\nvehicles to the contract of sale out of the stocks available\nwith him. This was done after a delivery order had been\n addressed by the sales office at Bombay to the stockyard \nincharge for delivery of stated number of vehicles of\nspecified model to a particular dealer . Till such\nappropriation of vehicles, it was always open to the company\nto allot any vehicle to any purchaser or to transfer the\nvehicles from the stockyard in one State to a stockyard in\nanother State. \n\n                                    8 63 However, the respondent Assistant Commissioner of Commercial\nTaxes. levied tax under the Central Sales Tax Act on all the\nvehicles which moved to the stockyards in the States other\nthan Bihar from Jamshedpur. The appellant challenged the\nassessment orders in petitions filed under Article 226 but\nthese were dismissed by the High Court. On appeal to this\nCourt,.\n HELD : The order of the High Court and that of the Assistant\nCommissioner must be set aside. (i)The explanation of the procedure followed by the\nappellant which prima facie seemed to be business-like and\nplausible, together with the proved absence of any firm\norders, indicated that the allocation letters and the\nstatements tarnished by the dealers did not by themselves\nbring about transactions of sale within the meaning of\nSection 2(g) of the Central Sales Tax Act. It appeared'\n'from the material on record that generally the completion\nof the sales to the dealers did not take place at Jamshedpur\nand the final steps in the matter of such completion were\ntaken at the stockyards. Even on the assumption that any\norders had been received by the appellant they could not be\nregarded as anything but mere offers in view of the specific\nterms in the dealership agreement according to which it was\nopen to the appellant to supply or not to supply the dealer\nwith any vehicle in response to such orders. There,were,\ntherefore, no firm contracts which occasioned the movement\nof vehicles out of the State of Bihar. [870 D-871 B]\n(ii) Another serious infirmity in the order of the Assistant\nCommissioner was that instead of looking into each\ntransaction in order to find out whether a completed\ncontract of sale had taken place which could be brought to\ntax only if the movement of vehicles from Jamshedpur had\nbeen occasioned under a convenant or incident of that\ncontract, the Assistant Commissioner made his order on the\ngeneral basis that all transactions were of a similar\nnature. The Assistant Commissioner was bound to examine\neach individual transaction and then decide whether it cons-\ntituted an Inter-State sale exigible to tax under the\n\nprovisions of the Act.

Singh, for the respondents (in both the appeals). \nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by Grover, J. The only point for determination in these appeals, by certificate is whether certain sales of motor vehicles manufac- 8 64 tured by the appellant were inter-state sales and were liable to tax under the provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act 1956, herein-, after called \"the Act\". \nThe appellant carries on the business of manufacturing inter alia Tata Mercedes Benz trucks and buses, chassis, spare parts and accessories thereof at Jamshedpur in the State of Bihar. These are sold to the Government of India, the State Transport Corporations, commercial and industrial undertakings and other persons. These appeals relate to the assessments made by the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, hereinafter called the \"Assistant Commissioner\", with regard to the assessment periods April 1, 1964 to March 31, 1965 and April 1, 1965 to March 31, 1966. As the points are common to both the appeals we shall deal with the facts relating to the second period, namely, April 1, 1965 to March 31, 1966. \nThe appellant did not maintain any stockyard in the State of Bihar but in different States stockyards were being maintained since December 1964. This, it is stated, was done for the purpose of more effective distribution of the vehicles particularly ,among the network of dealers. These stockyards were operated by the appellant's own personnel and the sales of the vehicles, it is claimed, were effected to the dealers as well as to the other users in the different States from the stockyards. The dispute relates only to the assessment made in respect of the vehicles which moved from the manufacturing plant in Jamshedpur to the stockyards in different States in the country. The sales tax was duly paid in accordance with the respective State laws on the sales effected from the stockyards there. The Assistant Commissioner has levied tax under the Act on all the vehicles which moved to the stockyards in States other than Bihar from Jamshedpur. Tax amounting to Rs. 173 lakhs was levied on April 1, 1966 for the period April 1, 1965 to September 30, 1965. The appellant moved the Patna High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution in April 1966 challenging the order of assessment but petition was dismissed in limini in April 1966. This Court was thereafter approached against the order of the High Court and special leave to appeal was granted. The appeal was finally allowed in February 1967 and the High Court was directed to entertain and decide the petition on merits' in November 1967 an agreed order was made by which the previous order of assessment was set aside and fresh assessment was to be made in accordance with law. On January 24, 1968 the appellant addressed a detailed communication giving the entire procedure which was being followed in the matter of sales of motor vehicles sent to different States from the works at Jamshedpur. \n 865 It appears that the Assistant Commissioner paid a personal visit to the head office of the appellant at Bombay and relevant records were shown to him there or later on according to his requisitions. On March'13, 1968 he made the assessment order in which he created a demand for Rs.\n2,79,13,599.32 by way of sales tax under the provisions of the Act on the vehicles which had moved from Jamshedpur to the stockyards in the various States and had been disposed of from there. The appellant filed petitions under Art. 226 of the Constitution challenging the above order as also the assessment on similar lines for the period April 1, 1964 to March 31, 1965. The petitions were dismissed by a division bench of the High Court. \nThe controversy throughout has centered on the question whether the sales subjected to tax were of the nature which were covered by the provisions of the Act or whether those sales took place in the different States where the stockyards were situate and from where they were disposed of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act may be read in this connection. \n \"3. A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of inter- State trade or commerce if the sale or purchase- (a) occasions the movement of goods from one State to another; or (b) is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods during their movement from one State to another. Explanation I........................\n                         Explanation II......................... \n                         \"4. (1) Subject to the provisions contained in section 3, when a sale or purchase of goods is determined in accordance with sub-section (2) to take place inside a State such sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place outside all other States. \n                         (2) A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place inside a State if the goods are within the State- (a) in the case of specific or ascertained goods, at the time the contract of sale is made; and, (b) in the case of unascertained or future goods at the time of their appropriation to the contract of sale by the seller or by the buyer whether assent 8 66 of the other party is prior or subsequent to such appropriation. \n                         Explanation......................... \nIt is also necessary to refer to the definition of \"sale\" as given in s. 2(g). The substance of that definition is that sale means any transfer of property in goods by one person to another for cash or for deferred payment or for any other valuable consideration. As observed in Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. Bombay v. S. C. Sarkar & Ors.(1) a transaction of sale is subject to tax under the Act on the completion of the sale. A mere contract of sale is not a sale within the definition 'of \"sale\" in s. 2(g). A sale being transfer of property becomes taxable under S. 3(a) \"if the movement of goods from one State to another is under a covenant or incident of the contract of sale\". In Ben Gorm Nilgiri Plantations Co. Cooncor & Others v. Sales Tax Officer, Special Circle, Ernakulam & Others(1) , the provisions of S.\n5 of the Act came up for consideration and the principle settled by that decision would indisputably be applicable to S. 3 (a) of the Act.? It has been laid down that the sale in the course of export predicated connection between the sale and export, the two activities being so integrated that the connection between the two cannot be voluntarily interrupted without a breach of the contract or the compulsion arising from the nature of the transaction. To occasion export there must exist such a bond between the contract of sale and the actual exportation that each link is inextricably connected with the one immediately preceding it. The principle thus admits of no doubt, according to the decisions of this Court, that the sales to be exigible to tax under the Act must be shown to have occasioned the movement of the goods or articles from one State to another. \nThe movement must be the result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale. \nThe points which would require determination would be whether the transactions which have been subjected to tax were of sale within the definition of that expression contained in S. 2(g) and whether the movement of goods from Jamshedpur to the stockyards of the appellant in the different States was occasioned by any covenant or incident of the contract of sale. \nThe procedure according to which dealings took place and supply of vehicles was made was outlined in a communication which was addressed by the appellant to the Assistant Commissioner in February 1969. Prior to 1958 each dealer had to place every month what were called \"firm orders\" for the vehicles which the dealers wanted to purchase. By 1958 Tata Mercedes Benz (1) [1961] 1 S.C. R. 379.\n [2 [1964 ] 7 S.C.R. 706. \n8 6 7 vehicles are stated to have gained remarkable reputation for quality. The demand far exceeded the production. It was no longer necessary to restrict the production to any limited demand or to depend on the number of firm orders for planning of production schedule. Therefore about the year 1958 the appellant stopped insisting on the firm orders from the dealers. It was asserted that the company's records did not contain any firm orders after 1958. It is unnecessary to mention certain circulars issued by the company prior to the promulgation in May 1963 by the Government of India of the Commercial Vehicles (Distribution and Sale) Control Order 1963 which was valid upto September 1967. The Control Order provided for the general principles of distribution. Pursuant to the Control Order the, appellant issued a circular dated June-14, 1963 asking the dealers to submit the following statements at the -end of each month instead of the weekly statements as submitted by them prior to the Control Order : (1) list of applications registered during the month; (2) list of retail sales during the month; (3) list of applications cancelled during the month and (4) stocks and sales report. The appellant explained that this was done to keep itself informed of the market movement and the sale prospects of the vehicles and to avoid any possibility of irregular allotment by the dealer. According to the appellant the extracts of the register kept by the dealer, could not, under any circumstances, be equated to firm orders nor was there any relationship between the actual number of vehicles supplied and the information contained in the extracts. \nA new form of dealership agreement (Ext. 1) was introduced by the appellant after the promulgation of the Control Order. Clause 1 (a) of this agreement provided that \"the company agrees to sell and supply from its works at Jamshedpur in the State of Bihar or from its depots and stockyards outside the State of Bihar to the dealer\" the.\nvehicles which shall allotted to the dealer by the company at its discretion for resale in accordance with the provi- sions of the agreement. Clause 11 (b) is reproduced below : \"The dealer shall mail to the Company on the 15th of each month, or so so that the Company will be in receipt thereof by the 20th of each month, his firm order for purchases to be effected during the next succeeding month and his estimated requirements of the said vehi- cles for the two months following the next succeeding month, for the said vehicles. \nIn the communication which has been referred to before sent to the Assistant Commissioner it had been emphasised that although the above clause regarding the firm order was included in the dealership agreement, in fact no firm orders were called for in view of the Control Order. It was maintained that during the 8 6 8 relevant period sales were effected from the stockyards alone, the procedure adopted being as follows : The sales office of the appellant in Bombay, after taking into account the production schedule requirements of individual States, the Government directives and other relevant factors. instructed the factory at Jamshedpur to transfer stocks of vehicles to the stockyards in the various States. The instructions for transfer were given by the sales office by Stock Transfer Authorisation in which the model of the chassis and the number of units were mentioned along with the name of stockyard to which the same were to be transferred. Pursuant to the Stock Transfer Authorisation the works prepared a Stock Transfer Memo which indicated the quantity of the vehicles to be transferred to the stockyard specified in the, Memo. This memo was signed by the transport contractor appointed by the appellant for transportation of the vehicles to the stockyards. On receipt of the vehicles at the stockyard any deficiency in or damage to the vehicles was noted by the stockyard incharge. Unless the damage to the vehicles was set right they were not appropriated to any contract of sale. The stocks available in the stockyards were distributed from time to time to dealers taking care to ensure that the overall supply to the dealers in any State would be in proportion to the number of orders pending with the dealer on May 1, 1963 or on the basis of the off-take by the dealer during the year ending September 30, 1962 as required by the Control Order. For this purpose allotments were made to the dealer for each month by an allocation letter by the sales office. It is claimed that the transfer of the vehicles from works to the various stockyards was a con- tinuous process and was not related to the requirement of any particular customer whether a dealer or a corporation or a private individual. These vehicles were transferred by way of stock to the stockyards or depots from where the transactions of sale were effected. It was pointed out that there was no connection between the Stock Transfer Authorisation and the allocation letter. The vehicles were delivered to the dealers as and when they were available in the stockyards irrespective of whether or not allocation for the dealers had been made or notified to them. There bad been many instances where the vehicles had been actually delivered from the stockyards prior to the issue of the allocation letter. The vehicles delivered to the dealer from the stockyard were accounted for against the allocation over the period. It was the stockyard incharge who appropriated the required number of -vehicles to the contract of sale out of the stocks available with him and put down the vehicle engine and chassis number in the delivery challan. This was done after a delivery order had been ,addressed by the sales office at Bombay to the stockyard in-charge 869 for delivery of stated number of vehicles of specified model to a particular dealer. Till such appropriation of vehicles through specification of the engine and chassis numbers, it was always open to the company to allot any vehicle to any purchaser or to transfer the vehicles from the stockyard in one State to a stockyard in another State. \nNow the Assistant Commissioner has not examined each transaction as indeed he ought to have done and has arrived at certain conclusions which appear to be wholly erroneous and are based on a complete misapprehension of the true position. He has firstly treated the allocation or alloltment letters together with their confirmation as transactions of sale. According to him once the availability of vehicles for allocation was determined for any particular month allocations were made to individual dealers and Stock Authorisation Memos were issued by the sales office at Bombay to the works at Jamshedpur. The movement of vehicles from the works to the stockyards was the direct result of the allocations so made. The conclusion on this point was in these words \"It was therefore clear that generally the movement of vehicles from works to the stockyards was not completely disassociated from the allocation made to the dealers. \n                         Consequently it would (7) not be said that the movement of vehicles from the works at Jamshedpur 'was completely unrelated to contract of sale\". \nIt was recognised that in some cases vehicles had been delivered to some dealers in advance against the allocation made for the following months. The appellant further showed and this was accepted that 15 vehicles from the Delhi stockyard were transferred to Karnal stockyard. After finding that the allocation letters together with their confirmation constituted transactions of sale the Assistant Commissioner referred to the dealership agreement and stated that on placing of the demand by the dealer a complete contract came into existence. He proceeded to regard the statements which were required to be furnished to the dealers in accordance with the letter dated June 14, 1963 addressed by the appellant to them as firm orders within the meaning of the relevant clause in the dealership agreement. \nThe final conclusion of the Assistant Commissioner was that as contemplated by clause 11 (b) of the dealership agreement every one of the dealers placed his demand or orders for supply which amounted to a contract for the sale of the vehicles demanded and clause 12 of the dealership agreement under which allocations were made by the appellant to the dealers amounted to fulfilment of orders. The appellant had throughout maintained that firm orders were no longer placed with it by the dealers after 1958. It has not been found or shown that 8 7 0 any such orders were in existence relating to the transactions in dispute. Thus on the question that transactions of sale took place the decision of the Assistant Commissioner rested mainly on the Allocation letters and the statements furnished by the dealers as required by the circular of June 14, 1963. \nIt is somewhat unfortunate that the High Court fell into the same error as the Assistant Commissioner as it accepted his findings on the ground that they were on questions of fact and could not be re-examined by the High Court. It was said that the terms ;and covenants of the contract made it clear that since the vehicles were despatched in pursuance of orders irrespective of appropriation or specific vehicles being sent to specific dealers the despatch and supply to the dealers must of necessity be regarded ,is integral part of a single transaction. It is difficult to see what -contracts the High Court had in mind because none have been shown to us even by the learned Advocate General for the State. He also relied largely on the findings of the Assistant Commissioner and urged that they were not open to re-examination. \nThe explanation of the procedure followed by the appellant -which prima facie seems to be business-like and plausible together with the proved absence of any firm orders lends support to the argument pressed on its behalf that the allocation letters and the statements furnished by the dealers did not by themselves bring about transactions of sale within the meaning of S. 2(g) of the Act. The Assistant Commissioner himself found that sometimes the vehicles were sent from the works at Jamshedpur even before an allocation letter had been issued. It would appear from the materials placed before us that generally the completion of the sales to the dealers did not take place at Jamshedpur and the final steps in the matter of such completion were taken at the, stockyards. Even if the appellant took into account the requirements of the dealers which it naturally was expected to do when the vehicles were moved from the works to the stockyards it was not -necessary that the number of vehicles -allocated to the dealer should necessarily be delivered to him. The appropriation of the -vehicles was done at the stockyards through specification of the engine and the chassis number and it was open to the appellant -till then to allot any vehicle to any purchaser and to transfer the vehicles from one stockyard to another. Even the Assistant Commissioner found that on some occasion vehicles had been moved from stockyard in one State to a stockyard in another -State. It is not possible, to comprehend how in the above situation it could be held that the movement of the vehicles from the works to the stockyards was occasioned by any covenant or incident of the contract of sale. As regards the so called firm orders 'it has already been pointed out that none have been shown to 871 have existed in respect of the relevant periods of assessment. Even on the assumption that any such orders had been received by the appellant they could not be regarded as anything but mere offers in view of the specific terms in Exh. 1 (the dealership agreement) according to which it was open to the appellant to supply or not to supply the dealer with any vehicle in response to such order. What was, therefore, relevant was the acceptance of firm orders occasioning the movement of vehicles out of the State of Bihar. \n Another serious infirmity in the order of the Assistant Com- missioner was (a matter which even the Advocate General quite fairly had to concede) that instead of looking into each transaction in order to find out whether a completed contract of sale had taken place which could be brought to tax only if the movement of vehicles from Jamshedpur had been occasioned under a convenant or incident of that contract the Assistant Commissioner based his order on mere generalities. It has been suggested that all the transactions were of similar nature and the appellant's representative had himself submitted that a specimen transaction alone need be examined. In our judgment this was a wholly wrong procedure to follow and the Assistant Commissioner, on whom the duty lay of assessing the tax in accordance with law, was bound to examine each individual transaction and then decide whether it constituted an inter- State sale exigible to tax under the provisions of the Act. \n Consequently the appeals are allowed and the order of the High Court and that of the Assistant Commissionor is set aside in so far as it relates to the assessments in dispute in the present appeals. It will be open to the Assistant Commissioner to make a fresh assesment in accordance with law. The appellant shall be entitled to costs incurred in this Court. One hearing fee. \n R.K.P.S.                       Appeals allowed. \n 8 72",

The petitioner is a Company incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 inter alia engaged in the business of manufacturing and sale of lighting equipment, electrical equipment, tools, drills, wrenches, hammers and other automobile electric tools etc., 3. It is submitted that the petitioner during the year 1996-97 undertook an expansion programme in anticipation of high growth and market demand, however could not sustainably run its business and was referred to the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (`BIFR' for short) on 18.07.2000. Subsequently, on 31.10.2001, the petitioner company was declared sick in terms of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985. \nIn the said proceedings, the petitioner company could not take steps to assail the assessment orders. However, the petitioner's aggregate tax liability was computed at Rs.11,92,01,000/- (Rupees eleven crores ninety two lakhs one thousand only) and inclusive of interest, stood at Rs.42,91,69,000/- (Rupees forty two crores ninety one lakhs sixty nine thousand only). The operating agency- Canara Bank directed the petitioner to reconcile its accounts with the claims of the respondents 2 to 4 since the petitioner did not had significant amount of sales turnover so as to attract tax liabilities aggregating to Rs.11,92,01,000/- (Rupees eleven crores ninety two lakhs one thousand only). Before the petitioner company could make efforts to reconcile the accounts, the respondent Nos.2 to 4 had initiated coercive recovery proceedings against the petitioner. \n 4. Learned counsel Sri.G.K.V.Murthy, appearing for the petitioner reiterating the grounds as aforesaid, submitted that no statutory Forms were submitted by the petitioner company to avail the reduced rate of tax. As such, huge tax liability has been created by the respondent authorities. Placing reliance on Rule 12(7) of the Central Sales Tax (Registration and Turnover) Rules, 1957 (`Rules' for short) which contemplates that the declaration in Form `C' or Form `F' or the certificate in Form `E-1' or Form `E-II' shall be furnished to the prescribed authority within three months after the end of the period to which the declaration or the certificate relates, provided that if the prescribed Authority is satisfied that the person concerned was prevented by sufficient cause from furnishing such declaration or certificate within the aforesaid time, that Authority may allow declaration or certificate to be furnished within such further time as that authority may permit , submitted that the prescribed Authority is empowered to accept the statutory Forms even at this stage if the petitioner shows sufficient cause. \n 5. In support of his contentions, learned counsel has placed reliance on the ruling of this court in the case of Weir BDK Valves Vs. Asst. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (Audit-1) and others in W.P.No.72328/2012 and connected matters (D.D.5.6.2015) as well as the Full Bench decision of Madras High Court in the case of State of Tamil Nadu Vs. Arulmurugan and Company reported in (1982) 51 STC 381. Learned counsel submitted that the respondents may be directed to re-assess the tax liability of the petitioner in a time bound manner considering the declaration Forms to be submitted to facilitate the petitioner to avail the benefit of Karasamadhan Scheme, 2019. \n 6. Learned AGA strongly objecting to the challenge made to the re-assessment orders relating to the assessment years 1995-1996 to 2007-2008 argued that no writ jurisdiction can be invoked by the petitioner to seek a remand to the Assessing Officer to furnish the statutory Forms at this length of time. \n 7. Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record. \n 8. There is no cavil on the proposition that the declaration Form can be filed at a subsequent point of time and not necessarily along with the returns. It is also well established principle that the declaration Forms can be filed before the Appellate Authority also. Rule 12(7) of the Rules reads thus: \" 12(7) The declaration in Form `C' or Form `F' or the certificate in Form `E-1' or Form `E-11' shall be furnished to the prescribed authority within three months after the end of the period to which the declaration or the certificate relates: Provided that if the prescribed authority is satisfied that the person concerned was prevented by sufficient cause from furnishing such declaration or certificate within the aforesaid time, that authority may allow declaration or certificate to be furnished within such further time as that authority may permit.\" \n 9. If the Assessing Authority is satisfied that the assessee was prevented from sufficient cause which disenabled him to file the Forms in time, the same can be accepted in terms of the proviso to Rule 12(7), albeit rule 12(7) prescribes a time limit of three months after the end of the period to which the declaration has to be filed, but that cannot be extended to decades . Prescribing three months time for furnishing declaration Forms may be directory but the same should be furnished within a reasonable time. The submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner to remand the matter now to the Assessing Authority to furnish the statutory declaration Forms relating to the assessment years 1995-96 to 2007- 08, at any stretch of imagination cannot be construed as the reasonable time to provide an opportunity to the assessee to avail the benefit of Karasamadhan Scheme 2019. \n 10. The provisions of the respective Acts provides a time limit for maintaining the books of accounts. For eg., in terms of Rule 26(10) of the Karnataka Sales Tax Rules, 1957, the accounts books are required to be maintained till the assessment for the year to which it relates has become final i.e., ordinarily eight years from the expiry of the year to which the tax relates. Similarly, in terms of Section 32 of the KVAT Act, 2003, five years or until the assessment reaches finality whichever is later. In terms of section 9(2) of the CST Act, 1956, General Sales Tax law of the State is applicable inasmuch as the assessment, re-assessment, collection and to enforce payment of any tax is concerned. \nThe time prescribed for re-assessment, revision, appeal, rectification of the orders relating to the assessment years in question has come to an end long back, ascertaining the genuineness of such declaration Forms would be infeasible and futile. Such being the position, it is hard to countenance the request of the petitioner to remand the mater to the Assessing Authority under the pretext of filing declaration Forms after decades. \n 11. In the judgment of Weir BDK Valves supra, the assessment order dated 25.05.2011 relating to the assessment year 2008-2009 and the consequential demand notices as well as the order passed by the Appellate Authority were challenged. The Appellate Authority has dismissed the appeal on the ground of limitation without accepting the declaration Forms submitted. Hence, this court allowed the writ petitions and restored the proceedings to the Assessing Authority to re- do the assessment taking into consideration the statutory Forms/declaration Forms furnished by the petitioner. \n 12. However, in the present case, no such declaration Forms are furnished, but it is only permission sought to furnish such declaration Forms before the Assessing Authority beyond the period of limitation to file an appeal before the Authorities. The inordinate delay of decades cannot be condoned merely for the reason that the proceedings were pending before BIFR. \n 13. The Full Bench of Madras High Court in the case of State of Tamil Nadu, supra, in the context of furnishing of declaration Forms under Rule 12(7) of the Rules has observed that the assessee did not file statutory Forms before the statutory Authority before the completion of the assessment, however before the Appellate Authority leave to file the relevant declaration Forms was sought for, but was declined. However, in further appeal the Tribunal accepted the same. In such circumstances, it has been held thus: \"18..... We do not think there is any room for the perplexity given expression to by the learned Government Pleader. Given the assessing authority's undoubted power to allow further time for C Forms to be filed on sufficient cause, the rest of it is mere procedure or follow up action. Where the assessing authority is satisfied, in a given case, about the existence of sufficient cause, it must necessarily be followed up by appropriate action, such as reopening the assessment already completed. Perhaps the requisite corrective action can be taken by invoking the assessing authority's statutory power of rectification of mistakes. Even otherwise, the implementation, in appropriate cases, of the power to allow further time cannot be withheld on the excuse that there is not express provision either in the statute or in the statutory rules for reopening the assessment. \n         When the power is there and the facts are there demanding its exercise, the implementation must be done as a matter of course, on the doctrine of implied or ancillary powers. Where there is a power, and where there is a will, there will be a way. It is, however, unnecessary to pursue the line of discussion further, because the particular problem we are concerned with in the two cases before us is quite different. What we are asked to consider, and what we have been engaged in discussing so far, is whether an appellate authority has the same power as the assessing authority to allow further time for accepting C Forms, and not how and by what process the assessing authority itself could exercise the power after the completion of the assessment. \n 14. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, there is no dispute with the aforesaid legal principle enunciated by the Hon'ble Court. In the present case, the challenge made to the assessment orders under the writ jurisdiction relating to the assessment years 1995-1996 to 2007-2008 cannot be entertained to enable the petitioner to avail the Karasamadhan Scheme, 2019. \n Writ petitions are bereft of merits, accordingly stand dismissed. \n Sd/- JUDGE Dvr:",

Counsel appearing for the respondents waives service. By consent the petition is taken up for final hearing. 2.  Leave to amend in terms of the draft amendment tendered, taken on record and marked \"X\" for identification. Amendment may be carried out forthwith. Verification dispensed with. \n 3.  The Assessing Officer has sought to reopen an assessment for AY 2004-05 by a notice dated 10 February 2011 issued under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. \n 4.  In the present case an order of assessment was passed under Section 143(3) on 30 October 2006. A notice was issued to the petitioner under Section 148 on 10 February 2011. The following reason has been supplied to the petitioner on 16 August 2011 for reopening the assessment \"You have claimed a melting loss in excess of 7.24%, which is higher than what is found in the similar line of business. So the melting loss earlier allowed is excess.\" \n 5.  The petitioner submitted objections on 9 November 2011 contending that the melting loss so claimed was in accordance with the audited accounts, the melting loss was duly disclosed in the books and statutory statements prepared under the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Central Excise Rules; and that in the course of the original assessment under Section 143(3), the Assessing Officer had duly verified the accounts, audit reports, sales/purchase register and all other relevant books maintained by the assessee. Moreover it was stated that the relevant records are inspected by the Excise authorities in the course of Excise audits and the percentage of melting loss will vary from factory to factory depending on the type and quality of raw material, machinery and process used. The objections have been rejected by the Assessing Officer with the following observations: \"Please note, on verification of your records for the year under consideration, melting loss claimed by you was found on higher side as compared to the rulings in that respect of the H'ble Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal, Pune Bench, Pune, in their judgement passed in ITA No.\n               696/PN/2006 for A.Y.2001-02 in the case of Saroj Castings Pvt.Ltd., Kolhapur. Normal allowable melting loss was ruled out at 5.5%, whereas, in your case it was claimed at 7.24%. In view of this fact, it was concluded, to that extent the assessment framed on 31/10/2006 has escaped the assessment by allowing excess claim of loss within the provisions of Sec.147 of the Act.\" \n 6.  Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that reopening of the assessment has taken place beyond a period of four years from the end of the relevant Assessment Year. There is no allegation in the reasons disclosed to the petitioner that there was any failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment. Ex facie, the reasons which have been disclosed would only indicate that there is a change of opinion on the part of the Assessing Officer. As a matter of fact, by the order dated 9 December 2011 the assessment is sought to be reopened upon verification of the records for the year under consideration which would show that there was no failure on the part of the assessee to disclose material facts necessary for the assessment. On the other hand, counsel appearing on behalf of the Revenue submitted that there was no discussion in the order of the Assessing Officer in regard to the quantum of melting loss. Since the Assessing Officer has indicated that the melting loss claimed by the assessee was on the higher side, it should be implied that income has escaped assessment. \n 7.  The original assessment was completed under Section 143(3). The assessment is sought to be reopened beyond a period of four years from the end of the relevant Assessment Year. The jurisdictional condition is that in such case before an assessment can be validly reopened, there must be a failure on the part of the assessee to state fully and truly all the material facts necessary for the assessment. There is no such allegation in the reasons which have been disclosed to the assessee. \n The Assessing Officer has purported to reopen the assessment only recording that according to him the melting loss of 7.24% which was claimed by the assessee is higher than what is found in a similar line of business. This ex facie would amount merely to a change of opinion. As regards the contention of the counsel appearing for the Revenue that there was no discussion in the original order of assessment under Section 143(3) on the aspect of melting loss, it is evident that when the claim of the assessee was accepted during the course of the assessment proceedings, the Assessing Officer, as is normal in such cases, had not adverted to the melting loss claimed by the assessee or the reasonableness thereof. The claim of the assessee was nonetheless accepted by the Assessing Officer in the course of the order of assessment under Section 143(3). The order which has been passed by the Assessing Officer while disposing of the objections of the assessee would in fact indicate that it was on a verification of the records of the assessee for the year under consideration that the Assessing Officer came to the conclusion that the melting loss was found to be on a higher side. The decision of the Tribunal in the case of Saroj Castings, which has been adverted to in the order of the Assessing Officer dated 9 December 2011, was rendered on 30 May 2008. The Assessing Officer could not have reopened the assessment on the basis of this subsequent decision of the Tribunal unless the jurisdictional requirements in the proviso to Section 147 were fulfilled. Moreover, the order of the Tribunal in Saroj Castings, a copy of which has been produced on record by the counsel for the assessee, does not indicate that any general principle of law was laid down in that case by the Tribunal. All that the Tribunal held there was that the Commissioner (Appeals) had properly worked out the reasonable wastage percentage as 5.5 % as against 6.6 % shown by the assessee in that case. \nAs a matter of fact, the order of the Tribunal would also indicate that it was only the Revenue which was in appeal against the determination made by the Commissioner (Appeals) which was not challenged by the assessee. Hence, looked at from every perspective, it is evident that the Assessing Officer has transgressed the limits on his jurisdiction for seeking to reopen an assessment beyond a period of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year. Counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee has drawn the attention of the Court to the fact that on 21 December 2011, this Court while issuing notice to the respondents had passed an ad-interim order in terms of prayer clause (c) restraining the respondents from acting on the impugned notice or proceeding further by way of re-assessment for A.Y. 2004-05. A communication was addressed to the Assessing Officer on 27 December 2011 drawing the attention of the officer to the order passed by this Court. The Assessing Officer passed an order of assessment on 30 December 2011 since the period of limitation was to expire. The assessee has filed an application dated 10 February 2012 before the Assessing Officer. Since the reopening of the assessment under Section 148 is not valid, the consequential assessment order dated 30 December 2011 would have to be quashed and set aside .\n 8.  Rule is accordingly made absolute by setting aside the impugned notice dated 10 February 2011, the order dated 9 December 2011 passed by the Assessing Officer on the objections of the assessee and the order of assessment dated 30 December 2011.

I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner accused No.7 and the learned High Court Government Pleader for respondent - State. 3. The case of the prosecution is that one Khalim Pasha filed a complaint on 4.6.2018 stating that he is into real estate business. He received a mobile call from mobile phone number 8747069459. The caller introduced himself as Jabbu from Tumkur and informed that some persons from Shivamogga have given supari to kill him and they have also given the photo and his mobile number. He further informed that his boys are staying at Bhadravathi and they will come to his house at about 10.00 a.m. He also demanded an amount of Rs.20 lakhs, for which the complainant told that he is ready to pay the amount. Thereafter, the complainant did not receive any calls and as such, he kept quiet. It is further case of the prosecution that one month after receipt of the said call, again he received a call demanding money and thereafter, the phone call was disconnected. Three days thereafter, again complainant received a call and the caller started asking whereabouts of the complainant and further told him to come near Gopalapuradal Road. It is further case of the prosecution that on the next day, again he received a call and the said person abused and threatened the complainant with dire consequences and thereafter, disconnected the phone call. It is further case of the prosecution that after four days, at about 7.30 p.m.\n complainant 's friend Abdul Rub's car was parked in front of his house. At that time, some unknown persons came and damaged the glass of the said car and in that context, a complaint has been filed before Doddapete Police. It is further case of the prosecution, that on 3.6.2018, at about 9.40 p.m., the complainant received a call to his number 9900601406 from mobile number 7624899969 and the caller introduced himself as Mujju and told the complainant to come near Ayodhya Hotel to which complainant told that he is in Bengaluru and at that time, phone call was disconnected. After 15 minutes, again he received the phone call and the said person told him that his guys are following him, they are also watching his movements and they are going to enter his house and the phone call was disconnected. It is further case of the prosecution that at about 12.00 p.m., in the midnight, the complainant slept and at about 4.00 a.m. when he woke up for having food as he was fasting in Ramzan month, at about 4.40 a.m., from the same mobile number i.e., 7624899969, the complainant received a call and the said person asked his whereabouts, to which the complainant replied that he has to go to Mosque for namaz; the called told him that he will not go to Mosque but he will be going to some other place and so also he told to peep from the widow. By hearing the same, the complainant peeped through the window to see as to whether anybody was there but he did not find anybody outside the house. \nThereafter, he opened the door. Immediately, two persons came on a motorbike covering the face with towel and fired towards the complainant. The said bullet hit to the gate and immediately complainant closed the gate and rushed inside the house. Thereafter, he received a call that today he has escaped but if money is not paid, next time they would finish him. On the basis of the said complaint, a case has been registered in the above said crime. \n 4. Learned counsel for the petitioner  accused No.7 submitted that the name of the petitioner was not found in the complainant or FIR. It is further submitted that accused Nos.1 to 4 and 10 approached this Court in Crl.P.No.5816/2019 and this Court by order dated 21.10.2019 has allowed the said petition. Subsequently, after the disposal of the petition, the present petitioner  accused No.7 has filed the petition to enlarge him on bail . \nOn the ground of parity, petitioner  accused No.7 is also entitled to be released on bail. It is his further submission that already the charge sheet has been filed and only allegation made in the charge sheet is that, the motorcycle belonging to accused No.7 has been given to accused Nos.1 and 2 and they have used for the purpose of commission of the offences and conspiracy has been alleged against him. But there are no ample material to connect the petitioner - accused No.7 to the alleged crime. \n It is his further submission that it is the first case which has been filed against the accused and he cannot be attributed to the alleged crime as he is the member of the organised crime and the provisions of the KCOCA Act cannot be invoked as against the petitioner  accused No.7. It is his further submission that the major offence punishable under Section is 307 of IPC and the said offence is not punishable with death or imprisonment for life. It is his submission that to attract the provisions of Section 307 of IPC the prosecution has to establish the same only at the time of the trial. He further submitted that the petitioner is ready to abide by the conditions to be imposed by this Court and also offer the surety. On these grounds, he prayed to allow the petition. \n 5. Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader vehemently argued and submitted that the petitioner - accused No.7 is an habitual offender and he is involved in 15 cases. He is a member of organized crime and there is lot of incriminating materials as against the accused to show that he is conspired with the accused persons. It is further submission that the petitioner  accused No.7 is enlarged on bail, he may again indulge in similar kind of criminal activities and there are already many cases pending against him. On these grounds, he pray to dismiss the petition. \n 6. I have carefully and cautiously considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Government Pleader and perused the records. \n 7. On going through the records, it indicate that earlier, accused Nos.1 to 4 and 10 have approached this Court and this Court taking into consideration about the applicability of KCOCA Act has come to conclusion and held that it is very difficult to draw any inference that there is an organized crime committed by the accused persons, therefore, the commission of KCOCA Act is doubtful, the same has to be established beyond reasonable doubt during the course of full dressed trial and by vide order dated 21.10.2019, granted bail to the said accused. In view of the fact that the offences alleged are not punishable with death or imprisonment for life, I am of the considered opinion that the only allegation made against petitioner - accused No.7 is that he has conspired with other accused persons and he has delivered his motorbike to accused Nos.1 and 2. Though it is not considered to be a serious allegation as against the petitioner  accused No.7 is concerned and even on the ground of parity also, the petitioner is entitled for bail. \n 8. In that light, petition is allowed. The petitioner  accused No.7 is enlarged on bail in crime No.410/2018 (Spl.C.C.No.893/2018) registered by Doddapete Police Station, Shivamogga, for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 384, 511, 307, 120-B, 114, 109 r/w.\n149 of IPC, Sections 25 and 27 of Indian Arms Act, 1959 and Section 3 of the KCOCA Act, subject to the following conditions:- i)    Petitioner shall execute a personal bond for Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs only) with two local sureties for the likesum to the satisfaction of the jurisdictional Court. \n ii)   He shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence in any manner till the disposal of the case. \n iii)  He shall not leave the jurisdiction of the Court without prior permission. \n iv)   He shall be regular in appearing before the Court till the trial is concluded v)    He shall mark his attendance once in fifteen days before Doddapete Police Station between the office hours of 10.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. till the trial is concluded. \n vi)   He shall not indulge in similar kind of criminal activities, failing which, the trial Court is at liberty to take the petitioner into custody. \n Sd/- JUDGE nvj",

The appellant has been sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment and fine of Rs.2,00,000/-. Thus the present appeal. 2. The appellant is stated to have been apprehended at Majhotli, by the police party, on suspicion, at about 6.15 A.M.\nafter he disembarked from the State public transport bus going from Nerwa to Chamunda. Two kilograms of Charas is stated to have been recovered from a bag in his possession in presence of PW-2, Sita Ram an independent witness. DW-1 Shayam Singh, the depot in-charge at Nerwa, and DW-2 Khem Raj, the conductor of the bus in question were examined as defence witnesses. \n 3. After consideration of the entirety of the evidence, particularly that of PW-2 and DW-2, and also noticing that PW-1, Constable Rakesh Kumar, an eye-witness to the incident, had not been mentioned as a witness in the seizure memo Exhibit PW-1/B, the Special Judge opined that two theories had emerged with regard to the accusations against the appellant. The appellant was acquitted, giving him the benefit of doubt. \n 4. The High Court reversed the acquittal, holding that PW-2 had admitted his signatures on Exhibit PW-1/B, the bag along with the narcotic, Ex.PW-2/A seal impression, Ex.PW-2/D the arrest memo and the Ex.PW-2/E personal search memo. No complaint had been lodged by the witness that he had been compelled by the police to sign the documents under pressure. The statements of the official witnesses, PW-1 Rakesh Kumar and PW-6 Head Constable Parmanand, were trustworthy, inspiring confidence, and could not be rejected only on the ground that they were police personnel. Any discrepancy with regard to distance and travelling time between Nerwa and Majhotli could be attributed to memory loss with passage of time, and was not required to be with mathematical precision. The time with regard to purchase of bus ticket had not been established. \n 5. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that he has been falsely implicated. He was deboarded from the bus at Chopal after it arrived from Majhotli and the narcotics planted on him. There had been no recovery from him. The bus ticket evidently reveals that he boarded the bus at 6:51 A.M. The question of his being apprehended at 6:15 A.M. simply does not arise. The road distance from Nerwa to Majhotli was 26 kms. as deposed by DW-1. In the hills, it would have taken the bus at least one hour or more, to cover this distance. The bus could not have reached Majhotli till 8:00 A.M. or thereafter. PW-2, the independent witness, deposed that he was stopped by the police at about 10.30 A.M. at Majhotli and after checking his motor cycle papers was allowed to leave. He was called to the Police Station at 1.00 P.M. and asked to put his signatures on certain documents. The witness denied any search, seizure and recovery from the appellant in his presence. If an independent witness was available, and relied upon by the prosecution, his evidence could not be discarded without reason, to hold that the police version was the truth. Additional submissions were made with regard to non-compliance with Section 50 of the Act, as there was personal search also, and that the complainant himself could not be the investigating officer. Reliance was placed on Basappa vs. State of Karnataka, 2014 (5) SCC 154 that if two views were possible, the acquittal ought not to have been interfered with in appeal. \n 6. We have considered the submissions on behalf of the parties, and also examined the evidence and other materials on record. \n 7. The public bus, on which the appellant was traveling, was going from Nerwa to Chamunda. The ticket issued to the appellant Exhibit DX, proved by the bus Conductor DW-2, bears the time of issuance 6.51 A.M., visible to the naked eye. The distance from Nerwa to Majhotli, is 26 kms. as deposed by DW-1. \nWe find substance in the submission on behalf of the appellant, that the travelling time for the bus, in the hills, for this distance would be one hour or more. Prima facie, the prosecution story that the appellant was apprehended at Majhotli at 6.15 A.M.\nbecomes seriously doubtful if not impossible. The bus would have reached Majhotli at about 8.00 A.M. or thereafter only. The conclusion of the High Court that passage of time, and memory loss, were sufficient explanation for the time difference, is held to be perverse, and without proper consideration of Exhibit DX.\nPW-2, the independent witness has stated that he was stopped at Majhotli by the police at 10.30 A.M. and was allowed to leave after verification of his motor cycle papers. The witness has specifically denied that the appellant was apprehended in his presence and that any search, seizure and recovery was conducted in his presence. He had deposed that he was called to the police station at 1:00 P.M. and asked to sign the papers. The witness was declared hostile. This aspect has not been considered by the High Court, which proceeded on the only assumption that the signatures were admitted. \n 8. In a case of sudden recovery, independent witness may not be available. But if an independent witness is available, and the prosecution initially seeks to rely upon him, it cannot suddenly discard the witness because it finds him inconvenient, and place reliance upon police witnesses only. In the stringent nature of the provisions of the Act, the reverse burden of proof, the presumption of culpability under Section 35, and the presumption against the accused under Section 54, any reliance upon Section 114 of the Evidence Act in the facts of the present case, can only be at the risk of a fair trial to the accused. \nKaramjit Singh vs. State (Delhi Administration), AIR 2003 SC 1311, is distinguishable on its facts as independent witness had refused to sign because of the fear of terrorists. Likewise S.\n Jeevananthanan vs. State, 2004(5) SCC 230, also does not appear to be a case where independent witnesses were available. \n 9. The presumption against the accused of culpability under Section 35, and under Section 54 of the Act to explain possession satisfactorily, are rebuttable. It does not dispense with the obligation of the prosecution to prove the charge beyond all reasonable doubt. The presumptive provision with reverse burden of proof, does not sanction conviction on basis of preponderance of probability. Section 35 (2) provides that a fact can be said to have been proved if it is established beyond reasonable doubt and not on preponderance of probability. That the right of the accused to a fair trial could not be whittled down under the Act was considered in Noor Aga vs. State of Punjab, (2008) 16 SCC 417, observing:- \"58......An initial burden exists upon the prosecution and only when it stands satisfied, would the legal burden shift. Even then, the standard of proof required for the accused to prove his innocence is not as high as that of the prosecution. Whereas the standard of proof required to prove the guilt of the accused on the prosecution is \"beyond all reasonable doubt\" but it is \"preponderance of probability\" on the accused. If the prosecution fails to prove the foundational facts so as to attract the rigours of Section 35 of the Act, the actus reus which is possession of contraband by the accused cannot be said to have been established. \n 59. With a view to bring within its purview the requirements of Section 54 of the Act, element of possession of the contraband was essential so as to shift the burden on the accused. The provisions being exceptions to the general rule, the generality thereof would continue to be operative, namely, the element of possession will have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.\" \n 10. In the facts of the present case, and the nature of evidence as discussed, the prosecution had failed to establish the foundational facts beyond all reasonable doubt . The special judge committed no error in acquitting the appellant. The High Court ought not to have interfered with the same. The submissions regarding non-compliance with Section 50 of the Act, or that the complainant could not be the investigating officer are not considered necessary to deal with in the facts of the case. \n 11. In Basappa (supra), it was observed that the High Court before setting aside an order of acquittal was required to record a finding that the conclusions of the Trial Court were so perverse and wholly unreasonable, so as not to be a plausible view by misreading and incorrect appreciation of evidence. The conclusions of the High Court in the facts of the present case are more speculative, based on conjectures and surmises, contrary to the weight of the evidence on record. 12. The order of the High Court is set aside. The acquittal of the appellant ordered by the Special Judge is restored. The appellant is set at liberty forthwith, unless wanted in any other case. The appeal is allowed. ........................................J.\n                             (L. Nageswara Rao) .......................................

Perused the materials placed before this Court. 2. The present petitioner has filed this petition under Section 438 Cr.P.C. seeking the relief of anticipatory bail in Crime No.8/2018 of respondent Police Station registered for the offences punishable under Sections 506, 498-A, 504, 143, 324, 149, 147, 148, 323 of the IPC and under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. \n 3. The summary of the case of the prosecution is that, on 09.05.2018 at 12.15 hours, the complainant Smt.Tarannum, wife of the present petitioner, lodged a written complaint with the respondent police alleging that, at the time of her marriage with the present petitioner on 22.09.2013, her parents had given sufficient dowry in the form of cash, gold and other articles. Even after the marriage, at the demand of the husband and her family members, some more valuables both in the form of cash and articles were given as additional dowry. Being dissatisfied with the same, she was further subjected to cruelty by her husband and other accused named in the complaint, demanding for additional dowry to be brought by the complainant. In the meantime, her husband, i.e., the petitioner herein went to Dubai. Even then the ill- treatment meted to her by the remaining family members of her husband continued unabatedly. Her husband after his return from Dubai in December 2017, apart from joining his family members in subjecting the complainant to cruelty, also started practicing unnatural sex with the complainant. When resisted by her, he used to physically assault her in different ways. In that process, a panchayat was held, where the accused were advised by the elders in the panchayat. A separate residence was put up for the complainant and the petitioner. Still, the cruelty continued unabatedly and went to the extent of the petitioner/husband suspecting the character of the complainant and parenthood of the child born to them. \nThe petitioner further proceeded in taking away of the gold and other valuable items found on the person of his wife and threw her out from his house. This made the complainant to come back to her parental house and lodge a complaint. \n The said complaint was registered against the petitioner and other eight accused shown in the complaint for the offences punishable under Sections 506, 498A, 504, 143, 324, 149, 147, 148 and 323 of the IPC and under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. \n 4. The learned counsel for the petitioner in his arguments submitted that, even according to the complainant, for a long time her husband was in Dubai. As such, any alleged cruelty by him is proved to be only an imagination. He further submitted that, there are no materials to show that the complainant, in any way and in any manner, was subjected to cruelty by any one of the family members of the accused. He also stated that, all other accused except the present petitioner have already been enlarged on bail, as such, the present petitioner also be enlarged on bail. \n 5. The learned HCGP appearing for the respondent State, both in his written objection as well in his oral submission, submitted that a bare reading of the complaint on its facial value, at this stage, makes out a prima facie case in favour of the complainant. He also submitted that the complainant has given in detail the instances how, when and where she was subjected to cruelty by the family members of the petitioner herein. \nThe allegations leveled against the present petitioner/accused No.1 being more serious compared to the other accused, the principle of parity is not applicable in the instant case. \n 6. A reading of the complaint, at this stage and prima facie go to show that, the complainant/wife has made direct and specific accusation against her husband of various nature. She has given instances as to how and in what form the dowry was given to her husband at different times. She has also shown in the complaint that, after return of her husband from Dubai, there was further aggravation in his attitude towards her, who not only continued subjecting her to physical cruelty, but also started practicing unnatural sex with her. She has also given reference of panchayat said to have been held among the elders of the family, which is said to have went in futile. \n 7. All these details given in the complaint at this stage and prima facie shows that, there are allegations made against the present petitioner, who is none else than the husband of the complainant herein. Even according to the prosecution, the apprehension of the present petitioner/accused is very much required for the investigating purposes, however, the petitioner/accused is said to be evading his arrest by the police. \n 8. For all these reasons, I am of the view that the petitioner has not made out a case for his enlargement on the relief of anticipatory bail. Accordingly, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER The petition is rejected as devoid of merits. \n Sd/- JUDGE gab",

The case of the prosecution in brief is that, on 20.10.2014 at around 12:15 pm, Sudhir Kumar Sahu, S.I. of Excise, Rajgangpur Mobile and other staff members of his office, while conducting patrolling in Kansbahal (Stationpada) village, spotted the accused walking suspiciously on the said village road holding a plastic jerrycan in his hand. Upon the basis of such suspicion, the S.I detained the accused and conducted search, during which they recovered one plastic jerrycan containing 05 litres of I.D liquor. \nThen the S.I conducted blue litmus paper test during which the paper turned into red and conducted Hydrometer Test thereon and found its temperature to be 78 F, Spindle Indication- 85.2 and Strength-61.0 U.P. From the findings of said tests as well as from his departmental experience the S.I concluded that the liquid was I.D liquor. On demand the accused failed to produce any authentic document or licence for legitimising his possession of the said liquor. Hence, on completion of enquiry the S.I of Excise submitted P.R against the accused. \n 3. The plea of the accused is of complete denial and false implication as is revealed from his statement u/s. 313 Cr.P.C. \n 4. On the above factual matrix and after hearing both sides, I find that the points which call for determination, are as follows: Whether on 20.10.2014 at around 12:15 pm at the village road in Kansbahal (Stationpada) village, P.S- Rajgangpur:- i. the accused was found to be possessing 05 litres of I.D liquor without any licence or valid authority?\n ii. the I.D liquor and the jerrycan were seized from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused? \n 5. In order to prove its case the prosecution has examined two witnesses in toto. On the other hand, the defence examined none and led no evidence from its side. P.W.2 is the complainant-cum- I.O who has deposed about his patrolling and about detection of the incident. He stated that, he spotted and detained the accused. \nHe added that on conducting search, he recovered and seized one plastic jerrycan containing 05 litres of I.D liquor from the possession of the accused. He added that upon conducting litmus test over the seized liquid the blue litmus paper turned red. He also conducted Hydrometer Test and found its temperature to be 78 F, Spindle Indication- 85.2 and Strength-61.0 U.P. He deposed that upon conducting such tests and due to his training and service experience he ascertained that the seized liquid was nothing but I.D liquor. P.W.1 is an independent witness who has deposed that he does not anything about the incident. On the other hand, the defence has examined none and has led no evidence from its side. \n 6. Heard the arguments advanced by both the sides. Perused the evidence on record and carefully considered the arguments advanced by both sides with respect to both the points for determination. Considering the nature of evidence on record, both the points are taken up for determination together. \n 7. In order to establish an offence u/s. 47(a) of the Act, the prosecution must establish the following: (i) The seized substance was I.D. liquor (ii) That the said I.D. liquor was possessed by the accused without any licence or authority. (iii) That it was seized from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused. \nAlthough the evidence on record reveals that litmus test and Hydrometer Test have both been conducted, no conclusive test such as Chemical Examination has been conducted by the prosecution agencies. In the absence of Chemical Examination or any other kind of direct and cogent evidence, it cannot be conclusively proved that the seized liquid was nothing but I.D liquor. Therefore, it is held that the prosecution has failed to prove that the seized article is I.D liquor. \n 8. Besides that, as regards seizure, the prosecution has also not seized any identity document from the accused in order to establish that the seizure took place from the possession of none else but the present accused. Again, it is clear from the evidence of P.W.1-the sole independent seizure witness that no seizure has taken place in his presence. In absence of support from the independent witness, it is not prudent to rely solely upon the evidence of P.W.2 regarding the factum of seizure. Moreover, the seized I.D. liquor if any, has not been produced before this court during trial. Hence, in view of the same, even the seizure cannot be held to be proved to have occurred from none else but the accused in this case. Therefore, it is held that the prosecution has failed to bring forth any direct and cogent evidence against the accused, to establish the essential ingredients of offence u/s. 47(a) of the Act, and accordingly, both the points are answered in the negative in favour of the accused. \n 9.       In the result, considering the totality of facts and circumstances of the case and upon appreciation of the evidence on record, accused Budhram Minz is held not guilty for committing offence u/s. 47 (a) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915 and is therefore, acquitted u/s. 248 (1) of the Cr.P.C. He be set at liberty forthwith and be discharged from his bail bonds. 10. The seized items, if any, be destroyed after four months of expiry of appeal period if no appeal is preferred, and if preferred, be dealt with as per the direction of the appellate court. \n 11. Status of the accused: - Accused is on bail and is present.\n 12. Enter this case as `mistake of fact.'

This appeal under Section 260A(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (‘Act’) is directed against the impugned order dated 12th May 2013 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (‘ITAT’) in ITA No. 2183/Del/2000 for the Assessment Year (‘AY’) 1990-91. \n 2. While admitting this appeal the Court by its order dated 18 th May 2004 framed the following question of law for consideration: \"Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was correct in law in holding that the amount of Rs.9,32,855 was assessable as an adventure in the nature of trade' and not lone term capital gain' as declared by the appellant?\" \n 3. The brief facts leading to filing of the present appeal are that the Appellant, Smt. Raj Dulari Bhasin, aged about 94 years, who is having no regular source of income, was an owner of a house property at X-24, Hauz Khas, New Delhi (‘the property in question’). The land on which the property in question was located, had been acquired by her on 18th March 1958 for a sale consideration of Rs. 5,500. The land was purchased and the house so constructed was for self use and had been continued to be under her occupation for more than 30 years. The aggregate cost of construction was about Rs. 86,285. \n 4. On 2nd March 1988 the Assessee entered into an agreement with M/s.\n Mac Consolidation (‘the builder’) for construction of additional area on the property in question. However, this agreement did not materialize on account of financial strains, old age and ill health. Thereafter, on 1 st April 1989 a fresh agreement was entered into by the Assessee with the builder, a copy of which has been placed on record, stating that the Assessee had approached the builder for their assistance in the construction of the said residential building on the terms and conditions set out in the earlier agreement dated 2nd March 1988. 5. This agreement dated 1st April 1989 clearly indicated that the agreement dated 2nd March 1988 would be treated as cancelled. It also specified that the construction charges for the residential building having area of approximately 9,900 sq.ft. @ Rs. 350 per sq.ft. was agreed at Rs.\n 34,65,000, which would be incurred by the contractor. Clauses 7 and 8 of the agreement dated1st April 1989 read as under: “7. That in lieu of clause no. 2 of this agreement the owner had authorized the contractor to have the selling rights of the new construction to be made by him on the terrace of the existing property. And in this connection a separate General Power of Attorney dated 1st April 1989 has also been given. 8. That in lieu of the above said clause it was mutually decided that the contractor will give one flat to the Assessee to be constructed at the second floor having cost of Rs. 5,32,855. In additions to this the Contractor will give the difference of sales price and cost of construction as mentioned in clause no. 2 of this agreement.” 6. A deed of general power of attorney was executed by the Assessee in favour of the builder on 1st April 1989. The builder was inter alia authorized to sell the property in question to any other person, sale deed, mortgage deed/gift deed etc., to produce before the sub-Registrar concerned for registration and to get the same registered, receive the consideration thereof and to acknowledge the receipt of the same to deliver the possession.\n 7. The net result of the above agreement was that the entire pre-determined cost of construction was to be incurred by the builder and the Assessee was to be provided with a flat on the rear of the second floor at a pre- determined cost of Rs. 5,32,855. The Assessee was also entitled to the share of the profit on the sale of the flats. \n 8. The Assessee filed her return of income for the AY in question on 11th October 1990 declaring a profit of Rs. 4 lakhs under the head ‘long term gain’ and claimed deduction of Rs. 3,75,000 under Section 54B of the Act. \n The Assessee also declared net taxable income of Rs. 7,500 under the head 'capital gains'. \n 9. The said return of the Assessee was accepted by the Revenue under Section 143 (1)(a) of the Act. However, on 27th January 1997, after over six years, notice under Section 148 of the Act was sent by the Assessing Officer (‘AO’) to the Assessee asking her to file a return of income for the AY in question inasmuch as he alleged to have reason to believe that the income of the Assessee has escaped assessment. Pursuant to the notice, the Assessee filed a return of income on 17th February 1997 declaring the original income as declared in the return initially filed. A copy of the computation of income for the AY in question was also placed on record. \n 10. During the course of the assessment proceedings pursuant to the queries raised by the AO, the authorised representative of the Assessee on 20th November 1997 submitted the following details regarding the extent of construction carried out on the plot: Existing covered Covered       area Covered area       before demolished        construction by construction      before            MAC construction      Consolidation Sq.ft Sq.ft.            Sq.ft.\n Basement                -- --               900 Ground Floor           780                  --                  -- Front first floor     1470               1357.50              2250 Rear first floor        --                 --                  2250 Front        second 1125                 1125                 2250 floor Rear         second     --                  --                  2250 floor Total Sq.ft.          9900 11. Earlier, by a separate letter dated 22nd October 1997, the Assessee has furnished the names and addresses of the parties to whom the flats were sold. It appears that the rear and front flats on the first floor, the front flat on the second floor and the basement were sold to the different parties. \n The additional fact that requires to be noticed is that construction, profit and loss account (P&L) of the builder for the year ended 31st March, 1980 was placed on record before the AO. In the ‘Construction Account’ in the credit column, the builder disclosed the entire consideration received “by sale value of flats received on behalf of land owners’ as Rs.35,10,000/-. \n  It is not in dispute that the Assessee received Rs.4 lakhs towards share of the profit on the sale of the flats. 12. The AO passed an assessment order under Section 147/143(3) on 5 th March, 1999 in which the amount received by the Assessee was treated as business income. The AO computed the profit from the sale of the flats as Rs. 4,00,000 and then observed that if the cost of the flat on the second floor (retrained by the Assessee) was reduced from the cost of construction shown at Rs. 35,39,000 then the profit would be more. The AO then observed that “since the Assessee exploited the land owned by her to be used for construction of multi storey building , the activity undertaken is in the nature of trade and accordingly, the profit arising in sale of flats is assessable under head ‘profit from business’. The AO proceeded to hold that the deduction under Section 54E of the Act was not allowable to the Assessee since the flats were sold within a period 36 months and the profit arising therefrom was not long term capital gain. \n  The entire sum in the hands of the Assessee i.e. the cost of the flat plus a sum of Rs.4 lakhs = Rs.9,32,855/- was treated as the income of the Assessee under the head profit and gains of business. 13. The appeal filed by the Assessee before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [‘CIT (A)’] was dismissed on 8th March 2000. While dismissing the appeal filed by the Assessee against the order of the CIT (A), the ITAT held in the impugned order as under: “24. It is quite apparent from the facts of the case that the intention of the Assessee at the outset was to get the flats constructed by the contractor deploying his own funds (the contractor’s) and receiving in the process a sum of Rs. 4 lakhs being the excess of sale consideration over the cost of construction of the flats as also a flat on the second floor, the value of which was Rs. 5,32,855. The original property, i.e, ground floor and the mumty has remained untouched since the agreement between the Assessee and the contractor stipulated the construction of addition area of an approximately 990 sq.ft. out of which only a flat whose value was Rs. 5,32,855 came to the Assessee..... The net result of the whole exercise is that the original property remains intact and the entire new construction gets sold off and the assessee gets a flat in the additional space constructed. In our opinion, it is not possible to treat the sum of Rs.4,00,000 as falling under one head and the sum of Rs. 5,00,000 and odd as falling under a different head as according to us the aggregate amount of Rs. 9,32,885 would have to be treated as income arising from ‘an adventure in the nature of trade/business’.\" \n 14. We have heard the submissions of Mr. C. S. Aggarwal, Senior counsel for the Assessee and Mr. N. P. Sahni, Senior Standing Counsel for the Revenue. 15. Mr. Sahni urged that the amount constituting the value of the flat together with the share of the profits received by the Assessee was correctly characterised as business income. Alternatively it should be treated as short term capital gains and the tax effect would be the same. \n  He however did not dispute the fact that in computation of income, the cost of the land was not taken into account. Mr. Sahni referred to an agreement entered into by the Assessee with one of the flat buyers which showed that what was sold was also a pro-rata 17% of the share in the land. However, for the purpose of computation of taxable income arising from the sale of the flats only the cost of construction was considered. \n 16. On the other hand Mr. C.S. Aggarwal, learned Senior counsel for the Assessee, placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Shanti Banerjee (decased) by LRs v. Dy. Commissioner of Income Tax (decision dated 17th November 2015 in ITA No. 299 of 2003) where in similar circumstances the Court held that the transaction was not an “adventure in the nature of trade” and the receipt therefrom was not business income. As regards the plea that the construction took place on the additional portion of land apart from the originally constructed portion, it is pointed out that the entire facts were placed by the Assessee before the AO. \n 17. The Court finds that merely because the Assessee approached the builder for constructing the flats on the portion apart from the already constructed portion, would not make the transaction an 'adventure in the nature of trade.' All that the Assessee had received from the sale of the flats was a residential flat of the value of Rs. 5,32,855 and Rs. 4 lakhs in cash as a result of the agreement entered into with the builder. As explained by this Court in Shanti Banerjee (deceased) by LRs (supra), after considering the decision in G. Venkataswami Naidu & Co. v. CIT (1959) 35 ITR 594, Raja Bahadur Kamakhya Narain Singh v. CIT (1970) 77 ITR 253 and CIT v. R.V. Gupta (2002) 258 ITR 261, where the construction and sale of the flats do not change the character of the asset and there was no material to show that the Assessee ever had the intention to exploit the plot as a commercial venture, the transaction cannot be characterized as ‘an adventure in the nature of trade’ leading to the resultant receipt as business income in her hand. The fact that the Assessee got a flat on the rear second floor apart from the original constructed portion on the ground floor made no difference to the nature of the transaction. The AO, the CIT (A) and the ITAT have proceeded on an erroneous legal premise that the agreement entered into by the Assessee with the builder and the consequent sale of the flats by the builder on behalf of the Assessee was an adventure in the nature of the trade. 18. Accordingly, the question framed is answered in the negative i.e. in favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue. \n 19. It is seen that the Assessee, an aged lady of 94 years, has had to undergo the ordeal of litigation for more than two decades. In the circumstances, the Court is of the view that the litigation costs incurred Assessee must be compensated to some extent at least by the Revenue. \n  Accordingly, a sum of Rs. 50,000 as costs shall be paid to the Assessee by the Revenue within four weeks from today. 20. The appeal is accordingly allowed in the above terms. \n S.MURALIDHAR, J VIBHU BAKHRU, J DECEMBER 21, 2015 rk",

The complainant, who was not inclined to give\nthe bribe, made a written complaint to the Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police, Anti-Corruption Department (Dy SP)\nrequesting for suitable action. A trap was arranged by\nsmearing 15 currency notes of the denomination of Rs. 10/-\neach with phenolphthalein powder and, on the direction of\nthe Dy SP, two motbirs were requested to accompany the\nraiding party and to watch what happens. The motbirs went\nalong with the complainant to the residence of the appellant\nand witnessed the acceptance of the money given to him by\nthe complainant, the subsequent search for the recovery of\nthe currency notes from the appellant, the dipping of his\nhands in sodium carbonate solution and the consequent change\nin the colour of the hands into pink. \n\n         By the time the case came up for trial, the complainant\nwas dead. In the absence of the evidence of the complainant,\nthe trial Judge noted that the first demand of the bribe at\nthe factory of the complainant had not been proved. He,\nhowever, held that the evidence of the two motbirs was\nreliable and was amply corroborated by the recovery of the\ncurrency notes as well as the presence of phenolphthalein\npowder on the hands of the appellant. The trial Judge\nconvicted and sentenced the appellant under s. 161, I.P.C.\nand s. 5(1)(d) read with s. 5(2) of the Prevention of\nCorruption Act, 1947. \n\n         The High Court which examined the evidence of the\nmotbirs agreed with the findings recorded by the trial Court\nand dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant.\n\n         One of the contentions urged on behalf of the appellant\nwas that once the complainant was not available to give\nevidence not only of the first demand but also on the\npayment of bribe pursuant to the demand, the evidence of the\ntwo motbirs had assumed considerable importance and it was\nunwise and dangerous to place implicit reliance on their\ntestimony to convict the appellant\n570\nas (i) both the motbirs were petty clerks and (ii) by virtue\nof their service, they were likely to be under police\ninfluence.\n\n         Dismissing the appeal,\n^\n\n         HELD: Truth is neither the monopoly nor the preserve of\nthe affluent or of highly placed persons. In a country where\nrenunciation is worshipped and the grandeur and wild display\nof wealth frowned upon, it would be the travesty of truth if\npersons coming from humble origin and belonging to office-\nwise, wealth-wise lower strata of society are to be\ndisbelieved or rejected as unworthy of belief solely on the\nground of their humble position in society. [577-F ]\n\n         Khairati Lal v. The State, (1965) 1 Delhi Law Times,\n362 overruled. \n\n         In the instant case it is factually not correct to say\nthat both the motbirs are petty clerks: one was serving as a\nclerk in a nationalised bank and the other was a teacher in\na middle school. The testimony of the motbirs which had been\naccepted as wholly reliable by the trial Judge and the High\nCourt cannot be rejected on the sole ground that they are\npetty clerks. [577-E: 578-A-B]\n\n          It may be that officers of Anti-Corruption Department\nhave jurisdiction to investigate lapses on the part of\nclerks in nationalised banks. It is not clear whether the\nmotbir who was a teacher was a government employee or the\n school itself was a government school. It may be that the\nschool was receiving grant but if all institutions which\nreceive grant from government are styled as government\ndepartments and have to be treated as falling under the\npolice influence then the net will have to be spread so wide\nas not to exclude anyone as independent of police influence.\nThere is no justification in the submission that the two\nmotbirs were persons not likely to be independent of police\ninfluence.

JUDGMENT:          CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 45 of 1980 From the Judgment and Order dated the 17th October, 1979 of the High Court of Rajasthan in S.B. Criminal Appeal No. 39 of 1977. \n Frank Anthony and S.K. Jain, for the Appellant. \n         Badri Dass Sharma for the Respondent. \n         The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DESAI, J. Appellant Kishan Chand Mangal was convicted by the learned Special Judge (A.C.D. Cases), Jaipur, Rajasthan, for 571 having committed offences under section 161, Indian Penal Code and section 5(1)(d) read with s. 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, and was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs.\n 200/-, in default to suffer further rigorous imprisonment for one month on each count with a further direction that both the sentences will run concurrently. After an unsuccessful appeal to the High Court of Rajasthan, he has preferred this appeal by special leave. Appellant at the relevant time was serving as Factory Inspector, Ajmer and in that capacity he accompanied by his friend paid a visit on November 20, 1974, to the factory named 'Krishna Industries' whose proprietor was one Rajendra Dutt. Appellant said that his visit being after a lapse of one and a half year, the proprietor should pay him pocket money. Rajendra Dutt replied that his establishment was not covered by the Factories Act and showed disinclination to grease the palms of the appellant. However, appellant persisted in his demand and told Rajendra Dutt if he did not pay Rs. 150/- he was likely to be entangled in some legal proceedings. So saying appellant and his companion left. \nRajendra Dutt was not inclined to give the bribe demanded from him and, therefore, on November 22, 1974, he contacted Dy. S.P., A.C.D., Ajmer, P.W. 7, Mahavir Prasad and gave a written complaint Ext. P-12 complaining about the demand of illegal gratification by the appellant requesting for taking suitable action in the matter. He also produced 15 currency notes each of the denomination of Rs.10/-. P.W. 7 Dy. S.P.\nMahavir Prasad directed P.W. 3 Prahlad Narayan to bring two persons to witness the search and accordingly P.W. 1 Ram Babu and P.W. 2 Keshar Mal were requested to join the raiding party. 15 currency notes produced by the complainant were smeared with phenolphthalein powder and a memorandum of the same was prepared. The raiding party led by P.W. 7 Dy.\nS.P. Mahavir Prasad and including the complainant Rajendra Dutt, two motbirs P.W. 1 Ram Babu and P.W. 2 Keshar Mal, P.W. 3 Prahlad Narayan, a clerk in the Office of the Anti Corruption Department, started by a jeep driven by P.W. 6 Bajrang Singh to go to the residence of the appellant. \nOffice and residence of the appellant are situated in the same building. Complainant Rajendra Dutt and the two motbirs Ram Babu and Keshar Mal proceeded ahead and entered into the room used as residential portion of the building. Ram Babu and Keshar Mal stopped in the verandah and the complainant Rajendra Dutt went inside. Appellant was seen sitting on a cot. On inquiry by complainant Rajendra Dutt appellant replied that he was not well 572 and that he was suffering from cold Appellant then inquired whether complainant Rajendra Dutt had brought the money and the complainant replied that he had brought the money and handed over marked currency notes 15 in number each of the demonination of Rs. 10/- which the appellant accepted and put the same under his pillow. Rajendra Dutt came out in the verandah and as instructed, gave the agreed signal whereupon Dy. S.P. Mahavir Prasad, the two motbirs and others entered the room. Mahavir Prasad introduced himself as Dy. S.P. ACD, and asked the appellant whether he had accepted Rs. 150/- as and by way of bribe from complainant Rajendra Dutt. \nAppellant denied having accepted any bribe or any money from Rajendra Dutt whereupon a search of his person was taken. \nWhen the search of the person of the accused was being taken motbirs Ram Babu and Keshar Mal pointed towards the pillow indicating that the bribe taken by the appellant was kept underneath the pillow. P.W. 6 Driver Bajrang Singh was asked to lift the currency notes and the numbers were tallied with the memorandum prepared earlier. Hands of the accused were dipped in the solution of sodium carbonate which turned pink. After the memorandum was completed recording all these facts and after completing investigation sanction was obtained and the appellant was prosecuted for the aforementioned offences. \n By the time the case came up for trial complainant Rajendra Dutt was dead and his evidence was not available. \nProsecution examined the two motbirs Ram Babu and Keshar Mal, Dy. SP, ACD Mahavir Prasad, Clerk Prahlad Narayan, Driver Bajrang Singh and two others. Statement of the accused was recorded under s. 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and he offered himself as a witness in his defence. In his evidence he stated that on the date of occurrence around 4.30 p.m. when he was sitting in his cot complainant Rajendra Dutt came and took a seat in the chair placed nearby. Appellant enquired why he had come and whether he had brought any written complaint against Clerk Mr. Singhal. According to him, the complainant replied that action be taken against Singhal by recording his statement whereupon the appellant said that if the complainant has any grievance he should come with a written complaint. Appellant further stated that thereafter he went to the bath room for spitting cough and he came out and sat on the cot. Complainant Rajendra Dutt enquired whether he can drink water from a jug which was lying there. Thereafter Rajendra Dutt went 573 out of the room and soon thereafter 8 persons including Rajendra Dutt entered the room. He stated that two of the members of the raiding party caught his hands and when he tried to get himself released from the grip of those persons the grip tightened. One of the members of the raiding party then told him that he was Dy. SP, ACD, Ajmer and called upon him to produce Rs. 150/- he had taken from Rajendra Dutt. Appellant stated that he immediately told the Dy. SP that he had not accepted any money from Rajendra Dutt whereupon the Dy. SP came near him and put his hand in the pocket of the garment put on by the appellant. Appellant objected to any search being taken and insisted on keeping two respectable persons present. He further stated that Dy. SP quarrelled with him and then he sent a telephone message to S.P, Ajmer that a Factory Inspector has quarrelled with him and he should be provided with extra police help. Thereafter his hands were dipped in a solution but the colour of the solution did not change and remained white. Appellant then told the Dy. SP that Rajendra Dutt had come to complain against one Singhal, a Clerk and in support of this he produced Ext. D-2 marked collectively in respect of five letters. At this stage the Dy. SP according to the appellant asked Rajendra Dutt why he had given a false signal whereupon the complainant Rajendra Dutt informed the Dy SP that the bribe money was lying under the pillow whereupon the Dy SP removed the pillow and collected the currency notes. He further stated that he has been involved in this false case at the instance of K.C. Sogani, Factory Manager of Krishna Mills, Beawar. This was broadly the defence of the appellant as collected from his evidence. The learned special Judge noted the fact that the complainant Rajendra Dutt was not available and, therefore, the first demand at the Factory of Rajendra Dutt on November 20, 1974, has not been proved. The learned Judge, however, held that the evidence of two motbirs Ram Babu and Keshar Mal was reliable and was amply corroborated by the recovery of currency notes as well as the presence of phenolphthalein powder on the hands of the accused. The learned Judge rejected the defence version that the currency notes were planted when the appellant had gone into the bath room. The learned Judge accordingly convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned hereinbefore. \n The appellant having unsuccessfully appealed to the Rajasthan High Court, has filed this appeal by special leave. 574 Mr. Frank Anthony, learned counsel for the appellant contended that there are certain features of this case which would convincingly show that the prosecution case cannot be accepted. He enumerated the circumstances as: (i) absence of name of the appellant in the F.I.R. Ext. P-12; (ii) absence of evidence of demand as on November 20, 1974; (iii) absence of any prior arrangement where and when the complainant was to meet the appellant and, therefore, the trap could not be successfully arranged which might permit an inference that the whole story of acceptance of bribe money is concocted; (iv) further two motbirs P.W. 1 Ram Babu and P.W. 2 Keshar Mal were petty clerks specially selected by P.W. 3 Prahlad Narayan; (v) in their evidence they have tried to improve upon the prosecution version which shows their unconcealed interest in the success of the trap which would render them partisan witnesses; (vi) there are certain omissions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses which may indicate that the defence version of planting the currency notes when the appellant had gone to bath room is probabilised; (vii) that no inference be drawn from the fact that when hands of the appellant were dipped in the sodium carbonate solution it turned pink because admittedly when hands of the accused were caught by the members of the raiding party one or the other of them may have transmitted phenolphthalein powder to the hands of the appellant. \n Complainant Rajendra Dutt on whose complaint a trap was arranged was dead by the time the case came up for trial and his evidence was not available to the prosecution. However, the complaint Ext. P-12 filed by him was admitted in evidence because P.W. 7 Mahavir Prasad, the Dy SP who recorded the same gave evidence about the same. The averments in the complaint even in the background of these facts would not provide substantive evidence and the only use to which it can be put is that a complaint of this nature was filed which tends to explain the subsequent actions taken by the Dy SP. High Court has examined the evidence of two motbirs P.W. 1 Ram Babu and P.W. 2 Keshar Mal, and also the evidence of P.W. 7 Mahavir Prasad and agreed with the findings recorded by the trial court. We need not examine the evidence afresh but limit our examination to specific contentions raised by Mr. Anthony. \n The first contention is that the name of the appellant Kishan Chand Mangal is not to be found in Ext. P-12. That is true, but 575 what is stated in Ext. P-12 is that a Factory Inspector accompanied by his friend visited the factory of the appellant and demanded a bribe. Now, the appellant in his evidence as DW 1 has stated that complainant Rajendra Dutt did come to his house on November 22, 1974, around 4.30 p.m.\n Appellant further proceeds to say that Rajendra Dutt had some grievance against a clerk Singhal and appellant insisted upon giving a written complaint at the time of the visit of Rajendra Dutt. If Rajendra Dutt as is now contended wanted to falsely implicate the accused there is no reason why he would not mention the name of the appellant in Ext.\nP-12. On the contrary the absence of the name of the appellant in Ext. P-12 would indicate that probably the appellant had visited the factory of Rajendra Dutt after a long time and that is what transpires from Ext. P-12 that the visit of the appellant was after a year and half. It is reasonable to infer that Rajendra Dutt did not know the name of the appellant but knew him by the designation of his office as Factory Inspector. Therefore, the absence of name of Kishan Chand Mangal in Ext. P-12 is hardly of any significance. \n It was next contended that once Rajendra Dutt is not available for evidence there is no evidence as to the demand of bribe on November 20, 1974, and it is not open to the Court to spell out the demand from the contents of Ext. P- 12. It is undoubtedly true that Rajendra Dutt was dead before the commencement of trial. It is equally true that the F.I.R. lodged by him on November 22, 1974, cannot be used as substantive evidence nor the contents of the report can be said to furnish testimony against the appellant. Such an F.I.R. would not be covered by any of the clauses of ss.\n32 and 33 of the Evidence Act and would not be admissible as substantive evidence. The question still remains whether there is any evidence of demand of bribe on November 20, 1974, in this case. A fact may be proved either by direct testimony or by circumstantial evidence If appellant did not visit the Factory of Rajendra Dutt on November 20, 1974, and made no overtures demanding the bribe, on what rational hypothesis can one explain the visit of Rajendra Dutt to the office of Dy. SP, ACD on November 22, 1974, his producing currency notes worth Rs. 150; a superior officer like the Dy SP, ACD, making all arrangements for the trap and the raiding party going to the house of the accused on November 22, 1974. The visit of Rajendra Dutt soon followed by the raiding party at the house of the accused on November 22, 1974, is admitted. Coupled with this, the fact that Keshar Mal, P.W. 2 in his evidence stated that after Rajendra Dutt entered the room in which appellant was sitting, Rajendra Dutt on 576 entering the room asked the appellant, 'Hallo, how do you do'. He further stated that the appellant replied, 'I am sick and suffering from cold'. He deposed that thereafter the appellant asked, 'Have you brought the money', whereupon complainant Rajendra Dutt replied, Yes, I have brought the money'. He further stated that thereafter Rajendra Dutt took out the amount of currency notes from his diary and gave the same to the appellant who took the amount and kept it under the pillow on the cot. If there was no prior demand the subsequent events remain unexplained as also the demand as deposed to by P.W. 2 Keshar Mal. But Mr. Anthony urged that this part of the evidence of Keshar Mal cannot be accepted because he has not stated this fact in his statement recorded in the course of investigation. Simultaneously it was pointed out that the other motbir Ram Babu is totally silent in his evidence about this conversation between the appellant and the complainant. Undoubtedly, the omission in the police statement of Keshar Mal and non-mentioning all these facts by the co-motbir would raise some doubt in the mind of the court about this conversation but as pointed out earlier there are tell-tale circumstances which do indicate that there must have been a demand and, therefore, these circumstances as herein before set out will render support to the statement of Keshar Mal that the demand at the time of visit of Rajendra Dutt must be pursuant to earlier demand by the appellant. Therefore, it is not proper to say that there is no evidence of the demand of bribe as on November 20, 1974. \n It was next contended that if a bribe is demanded and agreed to be paid and if the complainant was contemplating not to pay the bribe but was thinking of initiating action against the officer demanding the bribe, obviously for the success of the trap to be arranged the time and place of meeting would be arranged and if it be so it would be mentioned in the F.I.R. It was said that the very absence of it would show that there was neither a demand of bribe nor any action was contemplated on November 20, 1974, as is now sought to be made out and, therefore, the court should not accept any evidence with regard to the trap. In view of the admission of the appellant in his evidence that Rajendra Dutt followed by a raiding party came to his house also used as residence-cum-office around 4.30 p.m. on November 22, 1974, omission to mention about the time and place of future meeting in the F.I.R. Ext. P-12 loses all significance. It is equally possible that on the very day when the appellant visited the factory of Rajendra Dutt and demanded bribe, Rajendra Dutt may 577 not have immediately planned to rush to the Anti Corruption Department. He had declined to give the bribe. In his view his factory was not covered by the Factories Act. These are the averments in Ext. P-12. They are not being relied upon as substantive evidence but are used to explain the conduct of Rajendra Dutt which has evidentiary value. If Rajendra Dutt did not negotiate giving the bribe and did not agree to give the bribe though the appellant persisted in the demand and threatened to involve him in court cases the question of any arrangement for any time and place for giving the bribe does not arise and obviously it could not have found its place in the F.I.R. Such things find mention in a F.I.R.\nonly when the victim agrees to grease the palms of the officer. Absence in such a situation of such averments in Ext. P-12 in this case is both natural and obvious. \n The next contention is that once Rajendra Dutt is not available to give evidence not only of the first demand but also the payment of bribe pursuant to the demand, the evidence of two motbirs assumes considerable importance. It was urged that both the motbirs are some petty clerks and it would be both unwise and dangerous to place implicit reliance on their testimony to convict the Government servant. Factually it is not correct to say that both the motbirs are petty clerks. Ram Babu was serving as a clerk in the Central Bank of India and Keshar Mal was serving as a teacher in Middle School at the relevant time. It is unfortunate that thirty five years after independence and in this age of common man, there is still not the eclipse of the high brow. Sanctity of word made dependent upon the office held or wealth acquired is a nauseating phenomenon. \nTruth is neither the monopoly nor the preserve of the affluent or of highly placed persons. In a country where renunciation is worshipped and the grandeur and wild display of wealth frowned upon, it would be the travesty of truth if persons coming from humble origin and belonging to officewise, wealthwise lower strata of society are to be disbelieved or rejected as unworthy of belief solely on the ground of their humble position in society. The converse unfortunately appears to be true. The submission was sought to be buttressed by reference to Khairati Lal v. The State(1). A learned single judge of the High Court rejected the testimony in that case of P.W. 2 Brij Nandan and P.W. 3 Krishan Kumar observing that they are petty clerks and cannot be styled as independent witnesses. We have moved far away in seventeen years and this 578 approach does not commend to us. We say no more. Therefore, without further discussing this aspect, we are utterly disinclined to reject the testimony of the two motbirs accepted as wholly reliable by the learned Special Judge and the High Court on the sole ground that they are petty clerks as if that by itself is sufficient to reject their testimony. That is a wholly irrelevant consideration. \n As a second string to the bow it was urged that Ram Babu was serving at the relevant time as a Clerk in the Central Bank of India and Keshar Mal was a teacher in the middle school at Ajmer and both of them were, therefore, by virtue of their service, likely to be under the police influence. It is difficult to appreciate this contention. \nUndoubtedly Ram Babu was a Clerk in a nationalised bank and it may be that officers of Anti Corruption Department may have jurisdiction to investigate lapses on the part of clerks in nationalised banks. It is not clear whether Keshar Mal who was serving in a Middle School was a Government employee or the school itself was a Government School. It may be that the school may be receiving grant but if all institutions which receive grant from Government and are, therefore, styled as Government Departments, and have to be treated under the police influence then the net will have to be spread so wide not to exclude any one as independent of police influence. We find no justification in the submission that the two motbirs were persons not likely to be independent of police influence. Both of them have been accepted as independent witnesses and they do satisfy the test of witnesses independent of police influence. Reference in this connection was made to Raghbir Singh v. State of Punjab(1), wherein this Court adversely commented upon selecting one Makhan, a sweeper in the whole time employment of police, as a witness in a trap case observing that the Anti Corruption Department should insist on observing the safeguard of selecting independent persons as witnesses as scrupulously as possible for the protection of the public servants against whom a trap may have to be laid. Makhan, a sweeper in the whole time employment of police can obviously not be said to be independent of police influence but how does he compare with a clerk in a nationalised bank and a teacher in a middle school ? It, therefore, cannot be said that the two motbirs could not be styled as independent witnesses. In passing it was submitted that Rajendra Dutt and Ram Babu must have intimately known each other because Rajendra Dutt had an account in the same branch in which Ram Babu was working as 579 clerk. If a Bank Clerk is supposed to be intimately connected with each account holder in the bank, banking service would receive encomiums from the society. But it is difficult to accept the submission that on this account Ram Babu could not be said to be independent witness and let it be recalled that by the time Ram Babu came to give evidence Rajendra Dutt was already dead. \n The next contention is that even if Ram Babu and Keshar Mal are independent witnesses there are certain inherent infirmities in their evidence which would render their evidence untrustworthy of belief. Before we examine this submission in detail let it be reiterated that the learned special judge who tried the case and had seen both these witnesses giving evidence has observed that P.W. 1 Ram Babu and P.W. 2 Keshar Mal are independent witnesses and there is nothing in their testimony which may induce any distrust about the facts stated by them and their evidence was relied upon. The learned judge of the High Court observed that both the witnesses are independent witnesses and there is no reason why their evidence should not be relied upon. \n It is now time to briefly refer to some of the omissions and contradictions brought to our notice with a view to persuading us to reject the testimony of both these witnesses. It was pointed out that according to Ram Babu both he and Keshar Mal told the Dy SP that the currency notes were under the pillow while according to Keshar Mal it was Ram Babu who pointed out that the currency notes were under the pillow. We find no contradiction in this statement because if plural used by Ram Babu was to be relied upon as a contradiction, cross-examination ought to have been directed on this point. It is necessary to point out that the cross-examination of both the witnesses is scrappy, jumpy and not pursuant to any set theory of defence. It is worthwhile to note that there is not the slightest challenge to the statement of both these witnesses that while waiting in the lobby outside the room both of them saw Rajendra Dutt giving marked currency notes to the appellant and appellant accepting the same and keeping them underneath the pillow. \nIt was also urged that both the witnesses in their respective statements in the course of investigation have not referred that they pointed out that the currency notes were kept under the pillow. A further omission was pointed out that while Mahavir Prasad has stated that accused started quarrelling with him which necessitated summoning additional police help, both the witnesses while referring to the 580 quarrel picked up by the appellant so as to support the evidence of Mahavir Prasad have failed to refer to this aspect in their statements in the course investigation. \nThese are omissions of trivial details and have hardly any bearing on the main part of the prosecution case. Along with this the earlier omission in the statement of Keshar Mal already discussed was reiterated. In our opinion the so- called inner variations between the evidence of these two witnesses and omissions of trivial details would not cause any dent in the testimony of these two witnesses. Mr.\nAnthony after referring to Darshan Lal v. Delhi Administration(1), urged that if Mahavir Prasad took search of the appellant for recovering the bribe it would show that neither Ram Babu nor Keshar Mal had seen appellant keeping marked currency notes under the pillow. Such an inference cannot be drawn. Ordinarily the police officer would start searching the person of appellant and while he was doing that act, he was told where the currency notes were kept by the appellant. Therefore, no such inference is permissible. \n It was lastly urged that the court should not be influenced by the fact that when the hands of the appellant were dipped in a solution of sodium carbonate it turned pink which would affirmatively show the presence of phenolphthalein powder on the tips of fingers of the hands of the appellant. The fact remains that the solution did turn pink when the hands of the appellant were dipped in it. \nThe explanation of the appellant is that both his hands were caught by the members of the raiding party and it is possible that the members of the raiding party whose hands must have already been soiled with the phenolphthalein powder when the arrangements were being made for laying the trap they must have transmitted the same to the hands of the accused. This contention stands belied by the evidence on record. Mahavir Prasad has deposed that he asked one Ganga Singh to demonstrate the phenolphthalein powder test. After that he was directed to wash his hands. No other member of the raiding party touched the phenolphthalein powder at the time of demonstration. Ganga Singh was a member of the raiding party but when the hands of the accused were sought to be dipped in the solution this task was assigned to SI Satya Narain. Undoubtedly there is nothing to show that his hands were soiled with phenolphthalein powder. The hands of Rajendra Dutt must have been soiled with 581 phenalphthalein powder because he took out the currency notes from his diary and passed them on to the appellant. \nBut it is not suggested that Rajendra Dutt caught the hands of the appellant. Therefore, it is not possible to accept the submission that when the hands of the appellant were caught in the ensuing quarrel between him and the Dy SP Mahavir Prasad, phenolphthalein powder must have been transmitted by persons holding the hands of the appellant. \nThis tell-tale circumstance would lend ample independent corroboration if there be any need to the evidence of Ram Babu and Keshar Mal that they saw Rajendra Dutt giving marked currency notes to the appellant and the appellant accepting the same and putting them underneath the pillow. \n Mr. Anthony urged that there are certain tell-tale circumstances in the case which would render the defence plausible. It was urged that the appellant did not disclose any guilty syndrome when the raiding party entered his room and at the first question he denied having accepted any bribe from Rajendra Dutt. How would these two circumstances be sufficient to reject the otherwise reliable testimony ? A person with a strong will would not be upset and may remain cool and collected. The appellant did pick up a quarrel with the Dy SP. Why ? His suggestion that he insisted on two independent witnesses being kept present appears to be an afterthought. The fact that the appellant picked up a quarrel is borne out from the evidence of the persons present there and by the action of the Dy SP in summoning additional police help. Therefore, we find no circumstances which would impinge upon the prosecution case. \n We read the entire evidence of two motbirs Ram Babu and Keshar Mal, evidence of Dy SP Mahavir Prasad, Ext. P-12, the F.I.R., and we are in agreement with the High Court that the case has been proved beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt. \nThe evidence of appellant himself does not raise a plausible defence and has been rightly negatived. \n Mr. Anthony further urged that the appellant did not demand bribe because there is no such evidence and that even if Rajendra Dutt appears to have given some currency notes the appellant was an unwilling victim and the court must frown upon such attempts of the police to make government servants commit offence. He relied 582 upon the oft quoted passage in Brannan v. Peek(1). In that case the finding was that when the second time the police constable attempted to give a bet the accused showed his reluctance to accept the same. That was also the finding of the justices. The Court frowned upon the police officers in the absence of an Act of Parliament going to the place of the accused so as to induce him to commit an offence. We fail to see how this observation has any relevance in the facts of this case. Once the suggestion that there was a demand of bribe is accepted the appellant could not be said to be an unwilling victim nor a fence sitter who was induced to fall a victim to the trap. \n Lastly it was urged that the court would not be justifiedni raising a presumption under S. 4 (1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. In the facts of this case and in the absence of presumption even if Rajendra Dutt gave some money to the appellant that by itself would not establish the offence and the case must fail. Reliance was placed on Bansi Lal Yadav v. State of Bihar(2). In that case the defence of the accused was that currency notes were thrust in his pocket. Taking cue from this statement, the court held that the acceptance of an amount other than legal remuneration having been admitted the presumption would arise under S. 4(1) and the burden would shift to the accused. It is in this context that this court held that where the accused says that involuntarily the amount was thrust in his pocket he could not be said to have accepted or obtained for himself any gratification other than legal remuneration which alone permits the presumption to be raised. Facts in this case being a demand and voluntarily acceptance, the presumption would squarely arise and has been rightly raised. Reliance was also placed on the decision of this Court in Sultan Singh v. State of Rajasthan(3). In that case the explanation of the appellant was that Rs. 100 was paid to him towards the arrears of revenue and in the absence of reliable evidence to the contrary the explanation was held acceptable. This is a decision on the facts of that case and would be hardly of any assistance in dealing with the points raised in this case. 583 Therefore, the charge is brought home to the accused and he has been rightly convicted and the sentence awarded being the minimum, no case is made out for interfering with the same. \n Accordingly this appeal fails and is dismissed. The bail bond of the appellant is cancelled and he must surrender to serve out the sentence. \n H.L.C.                                Appeal dismissed.",

At the hospital, the doctor declared Kundan to be dead. Hence, this case. 3. On receipt of the said F.I.R, it was registered vide P.S Case No.- 251/2006 dtd. 06.12.2006 by the IIC, Rajgangpur P.S u/ss.- 279/337/304A I.P.C against the driver of the offending Dumper bearing registration No. OR-14-3233. Thereafter, investigation into the case was commenced and charge-sheet was submitted against the above named accused, for having committed the offences punishable u/ss. 279/337/338/304A of the I.P.C, of which cognizance was taken in this case. Then police papers were supplied to the accused u/s. 207 Cr.P.C and particulars of the offences u/ss. 279/337/338/304A were read over and explained to him upon which he pleaded not guilty and claimed for trial. \n 4. The plea of the defence is one of complete denial against the accusations levelled, innocence and false implication as it revealed from his statement u/s. 313 Cr.P.C. \n 5. On the above factual matrix and after hearing the prosecution and the defence, I find that the points which call for determination, are as follows: Whether on 06.12.2006 at about 02:30 pm, on S.H-10 near Jampali Bypass which is a public way, the accused:- a. drove his dumper in a manner so rash or negligent manner likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person, thereby committing an offence u/s. 279 IPC? \n b. caused hurt to both the riders of the motorcycle bearing regd. No.\n     OR-16B-1010 by doing an act endangering life or personal safety of others, thereby committing an offence u/s. 337 IPC? \n c. causing grievous hurt to the driver and pillion rider of motorcycle regd. No. OR-16B-1010 by doing an act endangering life or personal safety of others thereby committing an offence u/s. 338 IPC? d. caused death of the deceased victim by a rash or negligent act i.e. driving the abovementioned vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, not amounting to culpable homicide, thereby committing an offence u/s. 304A IPC? \n 6. In order to prove its case the prosecution has examined seven witnesses in toto, P.W.1 being the informant, P.W.5 being his brother and is also the injured victim in this case, P.W.2 being a witness to the inquest held on the body of the deceased, P.W.3 being the elder brother of the deceased victim, P.W.7 being an independent seizure witness, P.W.6 being the M.O. who conducted the post-mortem of the deceased victim and P.W. 4 being an independent witnesses in this case. The prosecution has marked the Injury Reports of both the injured as documentary evidence on its behalf. On the other hand, the defence has examined the accused as the sole witness on its behalf. \n 7. Considering the nature of evidence on record, all the points for determination are taken up together for the sake of convenience. Going on to appreciate the evidence on record, it is noticed that P.W.1-the informant, P.Ws.2 and 4 have deposed that they do not know anything regarding this case. P.W.1-the informant and P.W.2 have only identified only indentified their respective signatures on the FIR and Inquest Report respectively. \n 8. P.W.3 being the brother of the deceased victim in this case, has deposed that his brother (deceased) and his friend were coming towards Rajgangpur with a motor cycle. In the meantime one Dumper dashed against their motorcycle from its back side at Jampali Square. Then, his brother was shifted to the clinic of one Dr. Dash clinic and then to IGH, Rourkela, on the same day at night at about 10:00 pm, he succumbed to death due to the injuries sustained by him. He has identified his signature on the Inquest Report and his signature thereon. P.W.5 being the injured victim in this case has deposed that on 06.12.2006 at around 01:30 pm while he was coming along with the deceased from Kutra on a motorcycle, one dumper dashed against their motorcycle from its behind near Jampali Bypass due to which both of them sustained injuries. He has deposed that he was shifted in an unconscious state first to IGH and then to V.S.S Patel Hospital, Rourkela. He has identified his signature of the Injury Report. In his cross-examination, he has stated that he had not seen the offending vehicle but on hearing of the sound he came to know it was dumper. \n 9. P.W.7 the sole independent seizure witness has deposed that he went to the P.S. with P.W.1 the informant and there police had seized the documents of the vehicle in his presence. He had identified his signature on the Seizure List. \n 10. P.W.6 being the Medical Officer has deposed that he had conducted post-mortem on the deceased Kundan Murai and found that the deceased had sustained multiple injuries which are grievous in nature which resulted in his death. However, despite the presence of strong medical evidence regarding the injuries sustained, not a single P.W. has attributed said injuries to have been caused by none else but the accused. D.W.1-the accused has deposed that he has no knowledge about this incident. Moreover, no P.W. including the informant himself has stated anything in his evidence as to who had caused the accident. The accused has also not been named in the FIR. Law stands settled and pronounced that FIR is not a substantial piece of evidence and it can be only used for the purpose corroboration and contradiction of the matters thereof. In the present case, the informant himself has deposed that he does not know anything about this case. In view of reasons cited above, this court finds that there is no cogent evidence on record in order to prove the commission of the alleged offences by the accused. Accordingly, it is held that the prosecution has failed to prove its case u/ss. 279/337/338/304A of the IPC against the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. \n 11. In the result, accused Jirku Barla is held not guilty u/ss.\n279/337/338/304A of the I.P.C. He is therefore, acquitted u/s 255 (1) of the Cr.P.C. He be set at liberty forthwith and be discharged (alongwith his surety) from his bail bonds. \n 12. Status of accused: - The accused is on bail and is present.\n13.

(2) the\naccused potency to perform the sexual intercourse and (3)\nWhether the accused had performed sexual intercourse during\nthe last 24-28 hours, from one Dr. P. K. Mittal, Medical\nOfficer, Nehru Municipal Hospital Abohar. As according to\nthe Government instructions in force at the relevant time,\nmedico-legal cases were to be examined by two doctors, Dr.\nP. K. Mittal examined the accused in the presence of Dr.\nMrs. L. K. Grewal attached to the same hospital. On\nexamination of the private parts of the accused, the doctors\nobserved the whole of the glans penis and corona of the\naccused covered with a thick layer of yellowish material\nwhich smelt like stigma. They therefore advised a thorough\nchemical and microscopic examination of the yellowish\nmaterial to find out if it was a layer of smegma or not to\nenable them to answer third query of the police and referred\nto the accused to the appellant who was posted as Chief\nMedical Officer, Ferozepur. The doctors in their forwarding\nletter stated that they had not at all disturbed the layer\nso that the appellant would examine the case in its original\ncondition and order the sample of smegma to be taken and\nsent for chemical examination if he felt like doing so\". The\naccused could be taken to Ferozepur by the police only two\ndays later. On going through the letter, the appellant wrote\nback saying that no special opinion by him was necessary and\nthat Dr. Mittal himself could take the scrapping of the\nyellowish material and send the same to the chemical\nexaminer Punjab for opinion. The chemical examiner Punjab,\nas well as the Professor of Pathology, Medical College,\nPatiala, whose opinion was sought expressed their inability\nto carry out any test for smegma as they had no arrangement\nfor the same. The accused was convicted and sentenced to\ndeath under s. 302 I.P.C. subject to confirmation of the\n\nHigh Court and to imprisonment for life under s. 376 I.P.C.\n The accused in his appeal claimed benefit of doubt\ncontending that the appellant as well as the other two\ndoctors failed to examine the glans penis of the accused\nwith a view to find out whether there were any injuries\nthereon or not. On this argument being raised, the learned\nJudges constituting the Division Bench felt that it was\nnecessary in the interest of justice to examine the\nappellant as a court witness. They, therefore summoned the\nappellant as a court witness and recorded his statement. At\nthe conclusion of the examination of the appellant, the\nlearned Judges felt that the appellant had intentionally\nmade a false statement with a view to shield his own guilt\nand to help the accused. They accordingly ordered the\nprosecution of the appellant under s. 193 I.P.C.\n\n         Allowing the appeal by special leave the Court. \n723\n^\n\n         HELD: (1) What the courts have to see before issuing\nthe process against the accused is whether there is\nevidence in support of the allegations made by the\ncomplainant to justify the initiation of proceedings against\nthe accused and not whether the evidence is sufficient to\nwarrant his conviction, but this does not mean that the\nCourts should not prima facie be of the opinion that there\nare sufficient and reasonable grounds for setting the\nmachinery of criminal law in motion against the accused. The\nmoment, this guiding principle is overlooked, the\nprosecution degenerates itself into prosecution which often\nis fought with evil consequences. In the instant case, the\nlanguage in which the observations of the High Court about\nthe exercise of pressure by the appellant on Dr. Mrs. L. K.\nGrewal are couched shows that the High Court was itself not\nprima facie satisfied about the validity of the action that\nit was taking. [732D-F]\n\n         (2) Prosecution for perjury should be sanctioned by\ncourts only in those cases where it appears to be deliberate\nand conscious and the conviction is reasonably probable or\nlikely. There must be prima facie case of deliberate\nfalsehood on a matter of substance and the court should be\nsatisfied that there is reasonable foundation for the\ncharge. [732G-H]\n\n         In the present case, as the examination of smegma lost\nall importance after the lapse of the performance of the\nalleged sexual intercourse, the appellant's statement was\nnot a matter of substance and the appellant does not appear\nto have made any false statement with a malafide intention. \nIn the circumstances, no useful purpose will be served by\nsubjecting the appellant to a lengthy, vexatious and\nexpensive trial which is not likely to end in his\nconviction. [732H, 733A-B]\n\n         Chajoo Ram v. Radhey Shyam & Anr. [1971] 1 SCC p. 744 \nreferred to. \n\n         (3) In the instance case (a) the appellant had not\nintentionally made a false statement. The words used by the\nappellant in answer to the question put to him by the High\nCourt taken as whole make it manifest that what the\nappellant meant to convey was that the accused was never\nphysically produced before him which fact is amply proved by\nthe strong documentary evidence viz. the affidavit of Harjit\nSingh Head Constable dt. 27th August, 1975 corroborated by\nthe entries in Roznamacha of the Police Station, city Abhor\nof dt. 17th March, 1973. (b) The question of disagreement\nbetween that two doctors and of refusal on the part of Dr.\nMrs. L. K. Grewal to give opinion about smegma were\n\npurposely introduced subsequently by someone other than the\nappellant with some oblique motive and (c) It is well known\nin the medical world that the examination of smegma loses\nall importance after 24 hours of the performance of the\nsexual intercourse. Non-invitation of this fact to the\nnotice of the learned Judges of the High Court has led to\nthe error, regarding the examination of smegma after two or\nthree days after the occurrence. [728H, 729A-D, 730G, 731A,\nE-F] \nObservation:\n\n         The show cause notice besides being not happily worded\nis laconic. It does not satisfy the essential requirements\nof law. Nor does it specify the offending portions in the\nappellant's lengthy statements which in the opinion of the\nHigh Court were false. In cases of this nature, it is highly\ndesirable and indeed very necessary that the portions of the\nwitness's statement in regard to which he has, in the\nopinion of the Court, perjured himself, should be speci-\n724\nfically set out in or form annexure to the notice issued to\nthe accused so that he is in a position to furnish an\nadequate and proper reply in regard thereto and able to meet\nthe charge.

Petition No. 1755-M of 1975. \n R. L. Kohli and Mrs. Urmila Sirur for the Appellant. \n         Hardev Singh and R. S. Sodhi for the Respondent. \n         The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JASWANT SINGH, J.-This appeal by special leave is directed against an order dated the 29th September, 1975 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh directing prosecution of the appellant for an offence under section 193 of the Indian Penal Code and asking the Registrar of the Court to lodge a complaint in respect of the aforesaid offence in the court of competent jurisdiction. \n         The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are: On the basis of recovery of the dead body of a minor girl of fourteen or fifteen years of age named Kaushalaya Devi from the residential house of one Bhajan Lal aged 35 years, resident of Abohar (hereinafter referred to as 'the accused') on the night between the 14th and 15th of March, 1973 when his wife and children were away, the accused was tried for the murder and rape of the said girl. To start with, the police did not effect the arrest of the accused who from the evidence recorded in the case appeared to be a big landlord. Later on, however, on the statement of the father of the deceased girl, a case was registered against the accused and he was taken into custody at 1.00 P.M. on the 15th March, 1973. Dr. C. D. Ohri who conducted the post mortem examination of the dead body of Kaushalaya Devi, deceased opined on the basis of the observations made by him that the death of the deceased had occurred as a result of asphyxia due to constriction of the neck which was ante mortem and sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death The doctor further opined that the deceased had been raped and the person committing the rape on her was bound to receive some scratches on glans penis. Accordingly at about 5.50 P.M. on the 15th of March, 1973, the police produced the accused before Dr. P. K. Mittal, Medical Officer, Nehru Municipal Hospital, Abohar, and requested him to opine as to (1) the nature of injuries on the person 725 of the accused, (2) the accused's potency to perform the sexual intercourse and (3) whether the accused had performed sexual intercourse during the last 24-48 hours. As according to the Govt. instructions in force at the relevant time, the medico legal cases were to be examined by two doctors Dr. P.\nK. Mittal examined the accused in the presence of Dr. Mrs.\nL. K. Grewal who was also attached to his hospital and found the following injuries on his person:- \"1. Circular bruise 2 1/2 cm in diameter present on the back of right arm 3 cm lateral to the axillary fold and 14 cm below the top of right shoulder joint, the circle being of upper lower arches with healthy central area.\n                            In each arch there are separate specs of reddish violet bruises suggestive of teeth marks. \n 2. 2 cm. in diameter rounded bluish red bruise which is comparatively much fainter, present laterally to bruise No. 1. It is uniform in appearance all over.\"\n  In the opinion of both the doctors, injury No. 1 was the result of teeth bite but as regards injury No. 2, the doctors expressed their inability to give any definite opinion. On examination of the private parts of the accused the doctors found that he was potent and capable of performing sexual intercourse. During the course of the said examination. the doctors also observed the whole of the glans penis and corona of the accused covered with a thick layer of yellowish material which smelt like smegma. They, therefore, advised a thorough chemical and microscopic examination of the yellowish material to find out if it was a layer of smegma or not to enable them to answer the third query made by the police and vide their letter No. 426 dated the 15th March, 1973 referred the accused to the appellant who was posted as Chief Medical Officer, Ferozepur. In their aforesaid forwarding letter, the doctors stated that they had not at all disturbed the layer of sample and had tried to take no sample so that the Chief Medical Officer \"would examine the case in its original condition and order the sample of smegma to be taken and sent for chemical examination if he felt like doing so.\" The police, was not however able to take the accused to Ferozepur before the morning of the 17th of March, 1973. Even on that day, it was only at six in the evening that the police could contact the appellant as he was stated to be away on an official errand. \nOn the aforesaid docket and the connected papers being put up before him, the appellant wrote back to Dr. P. K. Mittal saying that no special opinion by him was necessary and that he (Dr. Mittal) might send without any further delay the scrapping of the yellowish material mentioned by him 726 from the genitals to the Chemical Examiner, Punjab for opinion. The communication addressed by the appellant to Dr.\nP. K. Mittal ran as under:- \"From Dr. S. P. Kohli, Chief Medical Officer, Ferozepur.\n To Dr. P. K. Mittal PCMs-II, Medical Officer Incharge, Nehru Memorial Hospital, Abohar.\n Memo.

The full case of the accused is returned herewith. Sd/- S. P. Kohli, Detail attached               Chief Medical Officer, (3) three only.

Kohli, dated 17-3-73                                17-3-73.\" On receipt of the aforesaid communication from the appellant, Dr. Mittal carried out the instructions contained therein but not with out a certain amount of resentment as appears from the letter Exh. CL1/3 which runs as follows:- 727 \"From The Incharge, Nehru Memorial Hospital, Abohar. \n To The Chief Medical Officer, Ferozepur No. 6                                       Dated 18-3-73 Subject: Medical Examination of Bhajan Lal accused.\n Dear Sir, Reference your No. ML-SPL-/1973 dated 17-3-1973. \n The accused Shri Bhajan Lal was presented to me on 18-3-1973 at 9.50 AM and I have done the needful as per instructions given by you. \n I had referred the case to your goodself for final opinion as the Lady Doctor refused to give any opinion on the plea that she was not familiar with the appearance and smell of smegma and as for Govt.\n instructions where two Doctors are unable to agree on one point the case is to be referred to Chief Medical Officer of the Distt. for final opinion. Your goodself verified the same on phone from the Lady Doctor. I did not remember any instructions for taking the smear through the SHO Police and neither your goodself remember the same on your visit to this Hospital on 16- 3-1973 and 17-3-1973 in connection with the same case. \n Today again Lady Doctor is on leave and I am alone in the Hospital but still I am doing the needful under your instructions and to avoid any delay on my part.\n This is for your information please. \n Sd/- P. K. Mittal, 18-3-1973.\" The Chemical Examiner, Punjab as well as the Professor of Pathology, Medical College, Patiala whose opinion was sought by Dr. P. K. Mittal expressed their inability to carry out any test for smegma as they had no arrangement for the same. The Additional Sessions Judge, Ferozepur who tried the accused sentenced him to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code for the murder of Kaushalaya Devi subject to confirmation by the High Court and to imprisonment for life under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code for committing rape on her but acquitted the other four persons who stood their trial jointly with the accused. The murder reference and the appeal preferred by the accused against his convictions and sentences were heard 728 by a Division Bench of the High Court. During the arguments before the High Court, counsel appearing for the accused vehemently contended that the appellant had failed to examine the glans penis of the accused regarding the presence or otherwise of smegma and also if both the doctors failed to examine the glans penis of the accused with a view to find out whether there were any injuries thereon or not, the accused was entitled to the benefit of doubt. On this argument being raised, the learned Judges constituting the Division Bench felt that it was necessary in the interest of justice to examine the appellant who was working as Civil Surgeon, Ferozepur as in their view, the presence or absence of smegma on the glans penis of the accused was quite vital from the view point of the defence as well as from that of the prosecution. They, therefore, summoned the appellant as a court witness and recorded his statement. At the conclusion of the examination of the appellant, the learned Judges constituting the Bench felt that the appellant had intentionally made a false statement with a view to shield his own guilt and to help the accused. They accordingly ordered the prosecution of the appellant under section 193 of the Indian Penal Code as stated above. Upon hearing counsel on both sides and examining the record as well as the law bearing on the question in issue, we are satisfied that the impugned order cannot be sustained. The only three matters regarding which the High Court appears to have thought that the appellant made a false statement are as follows:- \"(1) that the accused was never referred to or produced before him; (2) that he did not pressurise Dr. Mrs. L. K.\n                           Grewal 'to make the endorsement \"I agree\" on the copy of the medico-legal report Exhibit C.W.1/1'; and (3) that Dr. P. K. Mittal did not tell him on telephone on the 15th March, 1973 that Dr.\n                           Mrs. L. K. Grewal had shown her inability to give her opinion regarding the presence of the smegma on the glans penis of the accused.\"\n  We shall deal seriatim with each one of the aforesaid portions of the appellant's statement which in the opinion of the High Court are the offending portions. Re. Matter No. 1: Though it cannot be gainsaid that the appellant was not quite accurate in stating before the High Court that the case of the accused was not referred to him, it cannot be said that he intentionally or deliberately made a false statement in that behalf with 729 a view to shield his own guilt or to help the accused as observed by the High Court. The words used by the appellant in answer to the question put to him by the High Court taken as a whole make it manifest that what the appellant meant to convey was that the accused was never physically produced before him. We are fortified in this view by the material on the record which unmistakably reveals that the police never caused the appearance of the accused before the appellant at Ferozepur. In his affidavit dated the 27th August, 1975, Harjit Singh, Head Constable, has categorically stated that it was he who along with Milkhi Ram and Bahadur Singh, Constables, took the accused on the morning of the 17th March, 1973 from Abohar to Ferozepur as he had been referred to the appellant by Dr. P. K. Mittal. He has further affirmed that on reaching Ferozepur at about 10.00 A.M., he learnt that the appellant was away on tour; that he waited for the appellant and it was on his return from tour that he met him in his office at 6.00 P.M. with the aforesaid letter of reference given to him by Dr. P. K. Mittal; that at the time of his meeting the appellant, the accused was in the custody of the aforesaid two constables in the compound and he did not take him inside the office of the appellant and the S.H.O. Darshan Singh was not with him at the aforesaid time of his interview with the appellant. The statement of Harjit Singh, Head Constable is fully corroborated by the following entries in the Roznamcha of the Police Station, City Abohar:- \"20. Sh. Harjit Singh Arrival/Depar-  17-3-73 H.C. City Abohar ture accused H.C. himself C. Bahadur Singh 589, Milkhi Ram 378 from P.S. City Abohar proceeded at 7.30 A.M. for Medical Examination by C.M.O. Ferozepur of Sh. Bhajan Lal accused u/s 302/376 IPC Case No. 49/73 under the super vision of Sh. Milkhi Ram. ------------------------------------------------------------ 3. Darshan Sing SI   Departure of 3At6-20 A.M. Pro S.                   17-3-1973             -ceeded to Feroze -pur with a Lorry Vr. No. 126268-60 for enquiry by SDM Ferozepur. \n Arrival               Reported back 40 18-3-19               P.M. after enquiry done by SDM Ferozepur. \n ------------------------------------------------------------ 730 In face of this strong documentary evidence, it is difficult for us to agree with the High Court that the appellant had intentionally made a false statement. \n Re: Matter No. 2: There is also no material worth the name to justify the observations made by the High Court that the appellant had pressurised Dr. Mrs. L. K. Grewal 'to add the words \"I agree\" in the copy of Medico-legal Report Exhibit C.W. 1/1 after the issue of notice to him.' There was, in our opinion, absolutely no reason for the appellant to feel apprehensive so as to impel him to pressurise Dr.\n Mrs. L. K. Grewal to make any addition in Exhibit C.W. 1/1 in face of the aforesaid communication No. 426 dated the 15th March, 1973 which was jointly addressed to the appellant by Dr. P. K. Mittal and Dr. Mrs. L. K. Grewal. In the said letter, there is not the slightest indication of any disagreement or conflict of opinion between Dr. P. K.\n Mittal and Dr. Mrs. L. K. Grewal. The fact that there was no disagreement between the two doctors is further borne out from the absence of the words \"I agree\" (purporting to have been added by Dr. Mrs. L. K. Grewal) in Exhibit C.W. 1/2 as also from the absence of the following words in Exhibits C.W. 1/2 and C.W.1/1 which are copies of Exhibit C.W. 1/5:- \"Since I have no experience of conducting the examination of males in rape cases, I am not familiar either with the appearance or the smell of smegma.\n  Therefore, I cannot give any opinion whether the layer present on the glans penis is smegma or not. \n Sd/-L. K. Grewal 15-3-1973.\" \n In view of the foregoing, it is not understandable how the question of disagreement between Dr. P. K. Mittal and Dr. Mrs. L. K. Grewal or of refusal on the part of Dr. Mrs.\nL. K. Grewal to give any opinion about smegma cropped up subsequently when there was not the slightest whisper about it either in the aforesaid letter dated the 15th March, 1973 jointly addressed by the said two doctors to the appellant or in Exhibits C.W. 1/1 and C.W. 1/2. It seems that the question of disagreement between the aforesaid two doctors and of refusal on the part of Dr. Mrs. L. K. Grewal to give opinion about smegma were purposely introduced subsequently by some one other than the appellant with some oblique motive. \n The remark in the above quoted letter dated the 17th March, 1973 addressed by the appellant to Dr. P. K. Mittal that the examination of smegma was unnecessary was also not without significance. It 731 is well known in the medical world that the examination of smegma loses all importance after 24 hours of the performance of the sexual intercourse. The following passage occurring at page 341 in Modi's Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology is apposite in this connection:- \"Presence of Smegma as Negativing Rape.-1. In July 1921, Mt. Ramdevi aged 15 years, made a report that three young men, viz. Panchu, Dabi and Jodha had committed rape on her. They were arrested and sent immediately to Modi for examination. None of them had any mark of injury on their genitals or anywhere else on their bodies. The first two had smegma on the glans penis covered by the foreskin; this proved that they could not have had sexual intercourse at least during the last twenty-four hours. The girl was also examined and found to have been used to sexual intercourse, at inasmuch as her hymen had old lacerations. She had no mark of injury to her private parts or to any other part of her body. \n                  The men were released. 2. On the 23rd February 1923, a man complained at the police-station that one Dhani had committed rape on his daughter. He was immediately arrested and sent to Modi for medical examination. He found a uniform layer of smegma covering the glands penis, gave an opinion that he could not have had sexual intercourse during the last twenty four hours. The man was released.\"\n          It seems that the attention of the learned judges of the High Court was not drawn to the above quoted passage for if it had been so, they would have been spared of trouble of dwelling on the matter relating to examination of smegma after two or three days of the occurrence. Re. Matter No. 3: The observations made and the conclusions arrived at by the High Court in regard to this matter are also not warranted by the material on the record. \nAs already shown, there was no question of inability on the part of Dr. Mrs.L.K. Grewal to give her opinion regarding the presence or absence of smegma on the glans penis of the accused on the 15th March, 1973 when the aforesaid letter of the even date was written by her to the appellant jointly with Dr. P. K. Mittal. Accordingly there was hardly any occasion for Dr. P. K. Mittal to tell the appellant on telephone on the 15th March, 1973 that Dr. Mrs. L. K. Grewal had shown her inability to give her opinion regarding the presence of smegma on the glans penis 732 of the accused, or for the appellant to verify the matter from Dr. Mrs. L. K. Grewal on telephone as suggested by Dr.\nP. K. Mittal in his above quoted letter dated the 18th March, 1973. As observed earlier, the so called refusal on the part of Dr. Mrs. L. K. Grewal has been introduced by some interested party with an ulterior motive. \n The High Court was also in error in adopting a negative approach to the question which it was called upon to determine. Instead of trying to find out whether there was no prima facie case justifying the issue of notice to the appellant, it adopted a negative approach and tried to find out whether there was no prima facie case against the appellant. This would be clear from the following observations made by the High Court at page 40 of the Paper Book:- \"At this stage, from the material which has been referred to above, it is difficult to hold that there is no prima facie case for coming to the conclusion that Dr. Kohli pressurised Dr. Mrs. Grewal to make the endorsement \"I agree\" on the copy of the medico-legal report Exhibit C.D. 1/1.\" It is true that what the courts have to see before issuing the process against the accused is whether there is evidence in support of the allegations made by the complainant to justify the initiation of proceedings against the accused and not whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant his conviction, but this does not mean that the courts should not prima facie be of the opinion that there are sufficient and reasonable grounds for setting the machinery of criminal law in motion against the accused. The moment this guiding principle is overlooked, the prosecution degenerates itself into persecution which often is fraught with evil consequences. The language in which the above quoted observations of the High Court about the exercise of pressure by the appellant on Dr. Mrs. L. K. Grewal are couched shows that the High Court was itself not prima facie satisfied about the validity of the action that it was taking. \n         All this apart, the impugned order cannot be sustained for another reason. It is now well settled that prosecution for perjury should be sanctioned by courts only in those cases where it appears to be deliberate and conscious and the conviction is reasonably probable or likely. It is also well recognised that there must be a prima facie case of deliberate falsehood on a matter of substance and the Court should be satisfied that there is reasonable foundation for the charge. (See Chajoo Ram v. Radhey Shyam & Anr. In the present case, as the examination of smegma lost all importance after the lapse of 24 hours 733 of the performance of the alleged sexual intercourse as shown above, the aforesaid statement of the appellant was, in our judgment, not on a matter of substance and the appellant does not appear to have made any false statement with a mala fide intention. In the circumstances, we do not think that any useful purpose will be served by subjecting the appellant to a lengthy vexatious and expensive trial which is not likely to end in his conviction. \n         For the foregoing reasons, we allow the appeal and set aside the aforesaid order of the High Court. Before parting with the case, we would like to make a few observations with regard to the show cause notice issued to the appellant. The said notice runs as follows:- \"IN THE PUNJAB AND HARYANA HIGH COURT AT CHANDIGARH Court on its own motion Criminal Misc.

Nor does it specify the offending portions in the appellant's lengthy statement which in the opinion of the High Court were false. In cases of this nature, it is highly desirable and indeed very necessary that the portions of the witness's statement in regard to which he has, in the opinion of the Court, perjured himself, should be specifically set out in or form annexure to the notice issued to the accused so that he is in a position to furnish adequate and proper reply in regard thereto and be able to meet the charge S.R.
