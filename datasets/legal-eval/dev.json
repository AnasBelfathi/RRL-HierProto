It\nentered into transactions in the nature of forward\ntransactions with parties at Bhatinda (in the Patiala State\noutside the taxable territories of British India) in which\nit suffered losses. The assessee claimed deduction of these\nlosses in the computation of its income. Held, that the losses incurred in Bhatinda could not be\ntaken into account in computing the income of the assessee\nin British India. Under the third proviso to s. 5 of the\nExcess Profits Tax Act, 1940 , that part of the business of\nthe assessee in which the losses occurred at Bhatinda was to\nbe deemed to be a separate business, and consequently the\nlosses incurred in non-taxable territory could not be taken\ninto consideration for purposes of Excess Profits Tax. The\nlanguage of the third proviso to s. 5 was one of exclusion\nand made the Act inapplicable to profits etc. of the part of\nthe business which arose in non-taxable territories. \nCommissioner of Income-tax v.

Rajagopala Sastri and D. Gupta, for the appellant. \nNaunit Lal, for the respondent.1961. May 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS, J. These two appeals have been brought to this Court on a certificates of fitness granted by the High, Court of Punjab under s. 66A(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. \nThe relevant facts are these. Messrs Chunilal Moonga Ram, a firm of Delhi, carried on a speculative business in bullion, mostly in ,old and silver, in Chandni Chowk at Delhi. For the assessment year 1946-47 it was charged to income-tax on its income from the business in the relevant accounting period. Similarly, it was charged to excess profits tax for the chargeable accounting period ending on February 6, 1946. \nOne of the appeals, Civil Appeal No. 39 of 1960, arises out of the assessment of income-tax and the other appeal, Civil Appeal No. 40 of' 1960, arises out of the assessment of excess profits tax. During the relevant accounting periods the firm entered into certain transactions called \"hedge\"\ntransactions in the billion market at Bhatinda (then a part of the Patiala State, that is, outside: the taxable territories of British India). It claimed-that it had incurred losses to non-residents there in the sums of Rs.\n6,366/- and Rs. 16,615/- in the said transactions and claimed that these losses should be taken into consideration in determining its 'income. It appears from the assessment order of the Income-tax Officer, Delhi, dated January 27, 1949 that the firm purchased certain \"sillies\" (bars of gold and silver) from a Bhatinda party on the telephone, which purchases were later confirmed by a letter or wire. \nSimilarly, the bars were also sold by the firm through a Bhatinda party on the telephone. Apparently , no delivery was intended to be taken or was taken of the bars bought or sold ; nor did the firm have any branch or agent at Bhatinda. The transactions were in the nature of forward transactions carried out by means of telephonemessages, letters or telegrams with parties at Bhatinda. \nThis was the nature of the transactions Which resulted in the losses for which the firm claimed deduction. The Income-tax authorities disallowed the claim on the ground that if the Bhatinda transactions had resulted in profits, such profits would have been exempt from tax in terms of s.14(2)(c) as it then stood and if the profits were exempt from tax , the proviso to a. 24(1) of the Act was a bar to the adjustment of the losses. The assessee then moved the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. The Appellate Tribunal, however, allowed the deduction claimed on grounds which are not very clearly stated. It appears; that the Tribunal proceeded on the footing that it was not possible to ,\"split up transactions of a business located in the taxable territories into two categories of transactions inside and outside such territories\" and even if such spliting up was possible, the Bhatinda transactions would fall within s. 42 of the Act and the income etc. therefrom would be deemed to have arisen in British India. In this view of the matter, the Accountant Member of' the Tribunal who delivered the judgment of the Tribunal said \"To start with, it seems to us that there is no warrant either in terms of s. 14(2)(c) or in terms of the proviso to s. 24(1) to split up the transactions of a business located in the taxable territories into transactions in taxable territories and transactions without taxable territories. Even if that treatment were permitted and the profits or losses resulting from transactions outside the taxable territories can be described as income, profits and gains, such income, profits and gains are deemed under s. 42 to have accrued or arisen in British India. The results of transactions of the nature under review are' therefore, not exempt from tax by virtue of s. 14(2)(c). The proviso to s.\n          214(1) does riot in any case come          into play. The Income-tax authorities have, in this view that we have, taken wrongly disallowed the assessee's claim for adjustment of losses amounting to Rs. 6,360/- and Rs.\n          16,615/-. We allow these losses.\" \nThe Tribunal accordingly allowed the two appeals. We may here state that the Income-tax authorities as also the Tribunal considered the claim for deduction in relation to the assessment for income-tax only. As to the excess profits tax there was-no separate discussion of the provisions of S. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 and they dealt with the assessment of excess profits tax as a mere consequential matter. \nThe, Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, then made two applications asking the Tribunal to refer certain questions of law arising out of its orders to the High Court of Punjab, The Tribunal cam to the conclusion that no questions of law arose out of its orders and rejected the applications. The High Court was then moved under s. 66 (2) of the Indian income-tax Act, 1922 and the High, Court heard the two applications together and directed the Tribunal to state a case on the following two questions which, in the opinion of the High Court, arose out of the Tribunal's orders.\n          (1) Whether the claim of loss in this case is governed by the provisions of S. 10(1) or 24(1) proviso read with s. 14(2)(c), or by the provisions of s. 42 ?\n (2) Whether on the facts of the case a loss of Rs. 22,981/- is allowable in computing the income of the assessee chargeable to the Excess Profits Tax ?\" \nThe Tribunal then' drew up a statement of case on the two questions aforesaid. By its judgement and order dated January 23, 1957 the High Court answered both the questions in favour of theassessee. Thereafter the Commissioner of Incometax, Delhi, asked for and obtained a certificate under s.66A(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act and on that certificate the present appeals have been brought to this Court. \nAs to the first question the learned Additional Solicitor- General, appearing on behalf of the appellant, has conceded that him 'not in a, position to dispute the correctness of the answer given, in view of the decision of this Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Indo-Mercantile Bank Ltd. (1). \nThis disposes of Civil Appeal No. 39 of 1960 which must be dismissed. \nIn Civil Appeal No. 40 of 1960 the second question falls for decision. In answering this second question the High Court has proceeded on two grounds : firstly, it has referred to s.5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, particularly the third proviss thereto, and contracting the provisions of that section with s.5 of the Business Profits Tax Act of 1947 has expressed the view that neither of these provisions touched the question whether losses incurred in an Indian State could be taken into account in assessing the taxable income of an assessee in British India for purposes of assessing excess profits tax or business profits tax ; it then referred to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Karamchand Premchand Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay (2) and said: \"It would seem that inspite of the slightly different language of the Excess Profits Tax Act from that of the Income-tax Act, no distinction has ever been drawn in this matter between the principles governing assessment to income-tax and the principles governing assessment to excess profits tax and in fact it would appear to have been the universal (1) (1959) 36 I.T.R, 1.\n(2) (1956)30I.T.R.849,          practice that decisions of the Income-tax authorities and High Courts have been followed by consequential orders relating to the same assessee's taxable income for the purpose of the Excess Profits Tax Act and the learned counsel for the Commissioner has not been able to cite any decision in which different principles have been applied in this particular matter. Admittedly one of the reasons given in his judgment by Chagla C.J.\n          for coming to the decision mentioned above 'was that the third proviso had been changed in the Business Profits Tax Act as compared with the Excess Profit-, Tax Act, but this is only one of a number of reasons and the questions has not been considered at all whether under the proviso in the Excess Profits Tax Act losses made in an Indian State could have been computed in assessing the assessee's income from business in British India. I can only say that in the circumstances it seems to me likely that if the point had arisen the same view that I.\n          have expressed above would have been taken, namely, that whereas for the excess profits tax profits earned in an Indian State could not be taken into consideration at all, such profits could be taken into account if brought into taxable territories for assessing profits tax and that is regards losses. they I could be taken into account in assessing the business whether they occurred in a State. or in what was British India.\" \nThe second ground given by the High Court depended on the facts found. The High Court expressed the view that, on the facts found it was doubtful if the losses in question could be deemed to have occurred in Bhatinda. \nIt said \"It is not in dispute that the only place where the assessee carries on business is Delhi and that its transactions in other markets are carried out by means of commu- nication by telephone or Post. There is no Suggestion that the firm has any agent or branch in any native State and it therefore seems to me that whether profits result or losses are incurred as the result of transac- tions of this kind even with firms in Indian States, the profits accrue or the losses are incurred at the place where the payments are received or from which they are made, namely, the firm's place of business at Delhi.\" \nOn behalf of the appellant it is contended that both the aforesaid grounds given by the High Court for the answer which it gave to the second question are unsubstantial. \nThe, first ground, it is contended, is untenable in law, and the second. proceeds not on the findings of fact arrived at by the Tribunal but on new findings made by the High Court, which course was not open to the High Court to take. \nWe consider that these contentions are correct. As to the first ground, it seems clear to us that under the third proviso to s.5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 where the profits etc., of a part of the firm's business accrued or arose it Bhatinda, that part of the, business shall for the purpose of the said section be deemed to be a separate business. If that is so the losses which arose at Bhatinda must also be the losses of a separate business. We may here read s.5 and the third proviso thereto : .lm15 \" s. 5. This act shall apply to every business of which any part of the profits made during the chargeable accounting period is chargeable to income-tax by virtue of the provisions of sub-clause (i) on sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 4 of theIndian Income-tax Act, 1922, or of clause (c) of that sub-section : Provided further that this act shall not apply to any business the whole of the profits of which accrue or arise in an Indian State and where the profits of a part of a business accrue or arise in an Indian State, such part shall, for the purposes of this provision, be deemed to be a separate business the \",hole of the profits of which accrue or arise in an Indian State and the other part of the busi- ness shall, for all the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be, a separate business.\" In Commissioner of Income-tax v. Karamchand Premchand Ltd.(1). This Court considered s. 5. of the Business Profits Tax Act, 1947 and pointed out the distinction between the third proviso thereto and the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1.940. This Court quoted. with approval the decision in Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, Bombay City v. Bhogilal H. Patel Bombay (2 ) and held that the language used in the third proviso to S. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 was one of exclusion and that Act did not apply to profits etc. of that part of the business which arose in an Indian State. If that part of the business has to be treated as a separate business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act, it is difficult to see how the losses incurred in an Indian State can be taken into consideration for the same purposes. We think that the High Court was in error in thinking that the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act did not touch the question which the High Court had to answer. On the (2) (1952) 21 I.T.R. 72, (1) (1960) 40 I.T.R. 106.contrary, we think that the proviso answers the question against the assessee. Now, as to the second ground given by the High Court. It seems to us that there can be no doubt that the assessing authorities proceeded on the footing that the losses for which the assessee firm claimed a deduction arose and were incurred at Bhatinda, even though the firm's place of business was Delhi. The Income-tax Officer, as also the Appellate Assistant Commissioner referred to s. 14(2)(c ) of the Income-tax Act, 1922; that provision related to income, profit-, or gains accruing or arising in an Indian State. \nThe assessing authorities proceeded on the footing that as the proof its we are exempt from tax in terms of s.\n14(2)(c), the losses arising out-. side the taxable territories could not be taken into account. The Tribunal did not rely on s. 14(2)(c), nor on the proviso to s. 24 (1) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. But it relied on s.42. That again shows that it proceeded on the footing that though the income actually arose outside the taxable territories, it should be deemed to have arisen with in the taxable territories by reason of its business connection in the taxable territories. The High Court had to answer the second question on the facts found; it could not.arrived at fresh findings of fact. Such a course was not open to it. \nIndeed, it is true that the Tribunal said that the firm's transactions could not be split up, but the actual decision of the tribunal proceeded on the basis that. even it the transactions could be split up, s.42 applied and the income actually arising at Bhatinda would be deemed to have arisen in the taxable territories and so the losses must be taken into consideration for arriving at the income. The Tribunal considered the matter solely from the point of view of the assessment of income-tax. It did not consider the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 and what effect it had in the matter of the assessment of' excess profits tax. We agree that if the incomedid not arise or accrue in Bhatinda but the whole of it arose in Delhi, the third proviso would have no application. \nIf however, part of the income etc. arose in Bhatinda, there that part of the business was a separate, business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act and the losses' incurred at Bhatinda could not be taken into account. We are of the view that on the facts found, the answer to the second question must be in favour of the appellant and against the assessee. Civil Appeal No. 40 of 1960 must, therefore, be allowed. \nThe two appeals were heard together and in view of the divided success of the parties, the parties must bear their own costs in both appeals. \nCivil Appeal No. 39 dismissed. \nCivil Appeal No 40 allowed,",

BY THE INSPECTOR OF POLICE                              .....APPELLANT(S)\n                                                        VERSUS  .....RESPONDENT(S)\n\nM. MURUGESAN & ANR.\n\n                             J U D G M E N T \n HEMANT GUPTA, J.\n 1. The State is aggrieved against an order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras on 24th April, 2019 constituting a Heterogeneous Committee of named persons to give its recommendations on the reforms that can be brought into practice for reformation, rehabilitation and re-integration of the convict/accused person to society and best practices for improving the quality of investigation. The Committee was mandated to submit report within eight weeks and that the State was directed to furnish data for each District. The Committee was to scrutinize the same and submit the final data separately along with the report. \n         The State was directed to provide office room for the Committee to conduct its meetings and to keep the documents and other materials in safe custody. 2. Such directions came to be passed in a matter pertaining to grant of bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19731. \n The High Court had admitted the accused to bail on 18th February, 2019 subject to certain conditions but passed an order to call for the details of the cases registered by the Police, final report filed, trial conducted and the result of such cases. The details were to bring to light the manner in which the entire criminal justice system is operating in the State. In pursuance of the directions so issued and the data provided, the impugned order was passed by the learned Single Bench. \n 3. The High Court after collecting the data in respect of the criminal cases registered, convictions and acquittals in each District proceeded to write a thesis on how the criminal justice system should function in the State. It was observed that the central aim of the criminal law is to reform the offender and to rehabilitate him in a bid to render him useful to society. The Court held as under: \"16. The situation calls for a thorough revamping of the Criminal Justice system in this State. It looks like the police are caught into this Vicious cycle. That shows on the poor record of convictions in serious crimes. \n                         Instead of finding a complete cure for the disease, police seem to be looking for temporary solutions without curing the disease. Unless we agree that there is a serious problem, there is no scope for change/improvement. \n 17. \"Once a Criminal Always a Criminal\" is the result of the present system prevailing in this state. We have forgotten the fundamental purpose of Criminal Justice 1 for short, `Code' system which is reformation, rehabilitation and re- integration of the convict into society. If an accused is pushed to the extremes by this system where he finds that even if he wants to turn a new leaf in his life, this system will not allow him, he will rather surrender to his fate and turn out to be a hardened criminal. A welfare state can never stoop down to such a level. \n xx  xx  xx 20. It goes without saying that the quality of investigation has come down drastically and the data provided by the police, referred supra, makes it evident. \nThe alacrity shown by the police in registering FIR and effecting arrest, is not seen in investigating the case, laying final report and taking the case to its logical end. \nThe recent circular dated March 20 issued by DGP states that all the police stations will henceforth have exclusive investigation wing. As per the directions, the investigation wing will be responsible for investigation and prosecution of all cases registered in the station, including cases identified by the law and order wing. \nFurther, the police officers attached to the investigation wing shall not be diverted to any bandobust work except with the prior approval of the zonal IG or commissioner of police. This is a step on the right direction. A conscious effort should be made by the investigating wing in every police station with the active coordination of the directorate of prosecution to take every criminal case to its logical end. The police should not be under the impression that their work gets over with registering FIR and effecting arrest. One of the main challenges for the prosecution in Serious crimes is the witness turning hostile due to various reasons. Witness protection scheme, 2018, which has now become the law of the land in view of the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mahender Chawla case (2019 (1) MWN Crl 340 (SC)), must be implemented effectively. The investigation officers must be updated on a regular basis on the March of law. \nCyber crimes have reached monumental proportions and criminals committing these offences are clearly having an upper hand since these criminals are intelligent crooks and police officers require regular training and exposure to tackle these crimes. A complete overhaul is required to enhance the quality of investigation.\"\n 4. The matter before the High Court was as to whether the accused are entitled to be admitted to bail, that is the jurisdiction conferred on the Court in terms of Section 439 of the Code. Before granting bail, the High Court is enjoined upon an obligation to issue notice of an application for bail to the Public Prosecutor if a person is accused of an offence which is triable exclusively by the Court of Session or which, though not so triable, for punishment of imprisonment for life. \n 5. We find that the Hon'ble Single Bench has committed grave illegality in retaining the file after grant of bail to the accused on 18th February, 2019. The jurisdiction of the High Court came to an end when an application for grant of bail under Section 439 of the Code was finally decided. 6. In State of Punjab v. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar & Ors.2, the High Court of Punjab & Haryana after deciding a criminal appeal continued to pass order in respect of offenders in other cases not connected with the matter which was dealt with by the High Court. \n        This Court deprecated the invocation of jurisdiction in a matter not connected with the appeal and that too after passing of the final order. The Court held as under: \"86. In view of the law referred to hereinabove, the Bench was not competent to entertain the said applications and even if the same had been filed in the disposed of appeal, the court could have directed to place the said applications before the Bench dealing with similar petitions. \n 2 (2011) 14 SCC 770 xx xx  xx 91. There could be no justification for the Bench concerned to entertain the applications filed under Section 482 CrPC as miscellaneous applications in a disposed of appeal. The law requires that the Bench could have passed an appropriate order to place those applications before the Bench hearing Section 482 CrPC petitions or place the matters before the Chief Justice for appropriate orders.\"\n 7. This Court in Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar referred to a case reported as Simrikhia v. Dolley Mukherjee and Chhabi Mukherjee & Anr.3 wherein the Court observed that inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code cannot be exercised to do something which is expressly barred under the Code. It was held that inherent powers cannot be exercised assuming that the statute conferred an unfettered and arbitrary jurisdiction, nor can the High Court act at its whim or caprice. The Code does not confer unlimited/unfettered jurisdiction on the High Court as the \"ends of justice\" and \"abuse of the process of the court\" have to be dealt with in accordance with law and not otherwise. The High Court has not been given nor does it possess any inherent power to make any order, which in the opinion of the court, could be in the interest of justice as the statutory provision is not intended to by- pass the procedure prescribed. It was also held that the High Court can always issue appropriate direction in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India at the behest of an aggrieved person, if the court is convinced that the power of 3 (1990) 2 SCC 437 investigation has been exercised by an investigating officer mala fide or the matter is not investigated at all, but even in such a case, the High Court cannot direct the police as to how the investigation is to be conducted but can insist only for the observance of due process as provided in the Code. The Court held as under: \"51. The inherent power of the court under Section 482 CrPC is saved only where an order has been passed by the criminal court which is required to be set aside to secure the ends of justice or where the proceeding pending before a court, amounts to abuse of the process of court. Therefore, such powers can be exercised by the High Court in relation to a matter pending before a criminal court or where a power is exercised by the court under CrPC. Inherent powers cannot be exercised assuming that the statute conferred an unfettered and arbitrary jurisdiction, nor can the High Court act at its whim or caprice. The statutory power has to be exercised sparingly with circumspection and in the rarest of rare cases. \n               (Vide Kurukshetra University v. State of Haryana [(1977) 4 SCC 451 : 1977 SCC (Cri) 613 : AIR 1977 SC 2229] and State of W.B. v. Sujit Kumar Rana [(2004) 4 SCC 129 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 984] .) 52. The power under Section 482 CrPC cannot be resorted to if there is a specific provision in CrPC for the redressal of the grievance of the aggrieved party or where alternative remedy is available. Such powers cannot be exercised as against the express bar of the law and engrafted in any other provision of CrPC. Such powers can be exercised to secure the ends of justice and to prevent the abuse of the process of court. \n               However, such expressions do not confer unlimited/unfettered jurisdiction on the High Court as the \"ends of justice\" and \"abuse of the process of the court\" have to be dealt with in accordance with law including the procedural law and not otherwise. Such powers can be exercised ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice as the courts have been conferred such inherent jurisdiction, in absence of any express provision, as inherent in their constitution, or such powers as are necessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in the course of administration of justice as provided in the legal maxim quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur id sine quo res ipsa esse non potest. However, the High Court has not been given nor does it possess any inherent power to make any order, which in the opinion of the court, could be in the interest of justice as the statutory provision is not intended to by-pass the procedure prescribed. \n(Vide Lalit Mohan Mondal v. Benoyendra Nath Chatterjee [(1982) 3 SCC 219 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 697] , Rameshchandra Nandlal Parikh v. State of Gujarat [(2006) 1 SCC 732 : (2006) 1 SCC (Cri) 481] , CBI v. Ravi Shankar Srivastava [(2006) 7 SCC 188 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 233] , Inder Mohan Goswami v. State of Uttaranchal [(2007) 12 SCC 1 : (2008) 1 SCC (Cri) 259] and Pankaj Kumar v. State of Maharashtra [(2008) 16 SCC 117 : (2010) 4 SCC (Cri) 217] .) 53. The High Court can always issue appropriate direction in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution at the behest of an aggrieved person, if the court is convinced that the power of investigation has been exercised by an investigating officer mala fide or the matter is not investigated at all. Even in such a case, the High Court cannot direct the police as to how the investigation is to be conducted but can insist only for the observance of process as provided for in CrPC. \nAnother remedy available to such an aggrieved person may be to file a complaint under Section 200 CrPC and the court concerned will proceed as provided in Chapter XV CrPC. (See Gangadhar Janardan Mhatre v. State of Maharashtra [(2004) 7 SCC 768 : 2005 SCC (Cri) 404] and Divine Retreat Centre v. State of Kerala [(2008) 3 SCC 542 : (2008) 2 SCC (Cri) 9] .) xx  xx  xx 64. An inherent power is not an omnibus for opening a Pandora's box, that too for issues that are foreign to the main context. The invoking of the power has to be for a purpose that is connected to a proceeding and not for sprouting an altogether new issue. A power cannot exceed its own authority beyond its own creation. It is not that a person is remediless. On the contrary, the constitutional remedy of writs is available. Here, the High Court enjoys wide powers of prerogative writs as compared to that under Section 482 CrPC. To secure the corpus of an individual, remedy by way of habeas corpus is available. For that the High Court should not resort to inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC as the legislature has conferred separate powers for the same. Needless to mention that Section 97 CrPC empowers the Magistrates to order the search of a person wrongfully confined. It is something different that the same court exercising authority can, in relation to the same subject-matter, invoke its writ jurisdiction as well. Nevertheless, the inherent powers are not to provide universal remedies. The power cannot be and should not be used to belittle its own existence. One cannot concede anarchy to an inherent power for that was never the wisdom of the legislature. To confer unbridled inherent power would itself be trenching upon the authority of the legislature.\" 8. This Court in a judgment reported as Sangitaben Shaileshbhai Datanta v. State of Gujarat4 was examining a question where a court after grant of bail to an accused ordered the accused and their relatives to undergo scientific test viz. lie detector, brain mapping and Narco-Analysis. This Court held that direction of the court to carry out such tests is not only in contravention to the first principles of criminal law jurisprudence but also violates statutory requirements. The Court held as under: \"7. Having heard the counsels for the parties, it is surprising to note the present approach adopted by the High Court while considering the bail application. The High Court ordering the abovementioned tests is not only in contravention to the first principles of criminal law jurisprudence but also violates statutory requirements. While adjudicating a bail application, Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is the guiding principle wherein Court takes into consideration, inter alia, the gravity of the crime, the character of the evidence, position and status of the accused with reference to the victim and witnesses, the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice and repeating the offence, the possibility of his tampering with the witnesses and obstructing the course of justice 4 2018 SCC OnLine SC 2300 and such other grounds. Each criminal case presents its own peculiar factual matrix, and therefore, certain grounds peculiar to a particular case may have to be taken into account by the court. However, the court has to only opine as to whether there is prima facie case against the accused. The court must not undertake meticulous examination of the evidence collected by the police, or rather order specific tests as done in the present case. \n 8. In the instant case, by ordering the abovementioned tests and venturing into the reports of the same with meticulous details, the High Court has converted the adjudication of a bail matter to that of a mini-trial indeed. This assumption of function of a trial court by the High Court is deprecated.\" \n 9. In another judgment reported as Reserve Bank of India v.\n General Manager, Cooperative Bank Deposit A/C HR. Sha & Ors.5, Reserve Bank of India challenged an order passed on an application under Section 439 of the Code, wherein an argument was raised that the poor depositors are not paid by the Bank out of the amount which has been received by the Bank. The Court issued directions that the Bank should start distributing the amount which is so far recovered by them from the accused. The Bank was directed to furnish details of the money paid to the poor depositors. The accused as well as the Investigating Officer and the Administrator of the Bank were directed to remain present in the Court. This Court found that such directions are beyond the scope of an application for bail filed by the accused under Section 439 of the Code. The Court held as under: \"6. We are of the opinion that the far-reaching consequences of the directions of the High Court are in 5 (2010) 15 SCC 85 a way beyond the scope of an application for bail filed by an accused under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the High Court, as much as anyone else, must stay confined to the issues relevant to the matter before it. It was thus not open to the High Court to pass orders which could affect the working of banks all over the country.\" 10. In Santosh Singh v. Union of India & Anr.6 while dealing with a public interest litigation petition filed by a petitioner who was deeply distressed with the rapidly degrading moral values in the society touching every aspect of life where making money has become the sole motto of society, this Court held as under: \"18. While there can be no dispute about the need of providing value-based education, what form this should take and the manner in which values should be inculcated ought not to be ordained by the court. The court singularly lacks the expertise to do so. The petitioner has a grouse about what she describes as the pervading culture of materialism in our society. The jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 is not a panacea for all ills but a remedy for the violation of fundamental rights. The remedies for such perceived grievances as the petitioner has about the dominant presence of materialism must lie elsewhere and it is for those who have the competence and the constitutional duty to lay down and implement educational policies to deal with such problems. \n 19. There is a tendency on the part of public interest petitioners to assume that every good thing which society should aspire to achieve can be achieved through the instrumentality of the court. The judicial process provides remedies for constitutional or legal infractions. Public interest litigation allows a relaxation of the strict rules of locus standi. However, the court must necessarily abide by the parameters which govern a nuanced exercise of judicial power. Hence, where an effort is made to bring issues of governance before the court, the basic touchstone on which the invocation of jurisdiction must rest is whether the issue can be addressed within the framework of law or the 6 (2016) 8 SCC 253 Constitution. Matters of policy are entrusted to the executive arm of the State. The court is concerned with the preservation of the rule of law. \n xx  xx  xx 23. It is unrealistic for the court to assume that it can provide solutions to vexed issues which involve drawing balances between conflicting dimensions that travel beyond the legal plane. Courts are concerned with issues of constitutionality and legality. It is difficult to perceive how matters to which solutions may traverse the fields of ideology, social theory, policy-making and experimentation can be regulated by this Court such as by issuing a mandamus to enforce a scheme of instruction in a particular subject in school education. \nShould a subject be taught at all? Should a set of values or a line of enquiry and knowledge be incorporated as a separate subject of discourse in an educational system? \nWould a horizontal integration of a given set of values across existing subjects better achieve a desirable result? Is it at all desirable to impose another subject of study upon the already burdened school curriculum? 24. These are vexed issues to which more than one solution may appear just. That is exactly the reason why a resolution of such matters must rest with those who have the responsibility to teach and govern over matters of education. Every good that is perceived to be in the interest of society cannot be mandated by the court. Nor is the judicial process an answer to every social ill which a public interest petitioner perceives. A matter such as the present to which a solution does not rest in a legal or constitutional framework is incapable of being dealt with in terms of judicially manageable standards.\" \n 11. We find that learned Single Judge has collated data from the State and made it part of the order after the decision of the bail application as if the Court had the inherent jurisdiction to pass any order under the guise of improving the criminal justice system in the State. The jurisdiction of the Court under Section 439 of the Code is limited to grant or not to grant bail pending trial. Even though the object of the Hon'ble Judge was laudable but the jurisdiction exercised was clearly erroneous. The effort made by the Hon'ble Judge may be academically proper to be presented at an appropriate forum but such directions could not be issued under the colour of office of the Court. 12. In view of the above, we find that the order passed by the High Court on 24th April, 2019 is not sustainable in law and the same is set aside. Consequently, the appeal is allowed. .............................................J.\n                                    (L.

The Income-tax officer included\nthe prize money in his income for the relevant assessment\nyear relying upon the definition of 'income'in clause (24)\nof Section 2 of Income Tax Act. On an appeal preferred by the respondent-assessee the\nAppellate Assistant Commissioner held that as the Rally was\nnot a race, the prize money cannot be treated as income\nwithin the meaning of section 2(24) (ix). The Tribunal on\nan appeal by the Revenue, held that the Rally was not a race\nand as it was a test of skill and endurance, it was not a\n'game' within the meaning of Sec. 2 (24) (ix). As the prize\nmoney received was casual in nature it fell outside Sec.\n10(3) of the Act. \nThe High Court on a reference at the instance of the\nRevenue,upholding the findings of the Tribunal,observed that\nthe expression 'winnings' cannotes money won by betting or\ngambling and therefore the prize money not represent\n'winnings'. Inasmuch as the amount in question was obtained\nby participating in a rally which involved skill in driving\nthe vehicle, it held, it cannot he included in the\nassessee's income, also because it fell outside the preview\nof s.10 (3).\nAllowing the Appeal, the Court,\nHELD:1. The expression 'income' must be construed in its\nwidest sense. The definition of 'income' is an inclusive\none. Even if a receipt does not fall within sub-clause (ix)\nor any of the sub-clauses of Sec.2(24) of the Act it may yet\nconstitute income. Hence the prize-money received by the\nrespondentassessee constitutes 'income' -as defined in clause (24) of\n\nSection 2 of the Act. (335-C)\n2.The High Court erred in reading several sub-clauses in\nSec. 2(24) as exhaustive when the statute expressly says\nthat the definition is inclusive. Even if a receipt does\nnot fall within the ambit of any of the sub-clauses in Sec.\n2(24) it may still he income if it partakes of the nature of\nincome. The idea behind providing inclusive definition in\nSec. 2(24) is not to limit its meaning but to widen its net. \nThis Court has repeatedly said that the word 'income' is of\nwidest amplitude and that it must he given its natural and\ngrammatical meaning. (335-D) \nKamakshya Narayan Singh v. C.LT 11 ITR 513 P.C., Navin\nChandra Mafatlal v. C.I.T, Bombay 26 ITR (SC)and Bhagwan Das\nJain v. Union of India 128 ITR 315 SC, followed. \nGopal SaranNarain Singh v. Commissioner of Income Tax,\n3ITR237 P.C., referred to. \n3.If the monies which are not earned in the true sense of\nthe word Constitute income, it is difficult to appreciate\nwhy do monies earned by skill and to not constitute income? \nThe Rally was a contest, if not a race. The Respondent-\nassessee entered the contest to win it. The Prize-money\nwhich he got in return for winning the contest was a reward\nfor his skill and endurance. It does constitute his income-\nwhich expression must be construed in its widest sense.\n(335-B)\n4.The sub-clause (ix) of Sec. 2(24), is not confined to\ngames of gambling nature alone.

(335-E) \n\nJUDGMENT:\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 3908 (NT)/ 1983. From the Judgment and Order dated 20.11.1979 of the Madras High Court in Tax Case No. 330 of 1976. \nA. Raghuvir and Ms. A. Subhashini for the Appellant. \nT.A. Ramachandran and Mrs. Janaki Ramachandran for the Respondent. \nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by B.P. JEEVAN REDDY, J. This appeal is preferred against the Judgment of the Madras High Court answering the question referred to it in the affirmative i.e., in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue. The question referred under section 256 (1) of the Income-tax Act reads as follows: \"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that the total sum of Rs. 22.000 received by the assessee from the Indian Oil Corporation and All India Highway Motor Rally should not be brought to tax?\" \nThe assessment year concerned is 1974-75. The assessee, G.R. Karthikeyan, assessed as an individual, was having income from various sources including salary and business income. During the accounting year relevant to the said assessment year, he participated in the All India Highway Motor Rally. He was awarded the first prize of Rs. 20,000 by the Indian Oil Corporation and another Sum of Rs. 2,000 by the All India Highway Motor Rally. The Rally was organised jointly by the Automobile Association of Eastern India and the Indian Oil Corporation and was supported by several Regional Automobile Associations as well as Federation of Indian Motor Sports Clubs and the Federation of Indian Automobile Associations. The rally was restricted to private motorcars, the length of the rally route was approximately 6,956 kms. One could start either from Delhi, Calcutta, Madras or Bombay, proceed anti-clock wise and arrive at the starting point. The rally was designed to test endurance driving and the reliability of the automobiles. One had to drive his vehicle observing the traffic regulations at different places as also the regulations prescribed by the Rally Committee. Prizes were awarded on the basis of overall classification. The method of ascertaining the first prize was based on a system of penalty points for various violations. The competitor with the least penalty points was adjudged the first-prize winner. On the above basis, the assessee won the first prize and received a total sum of Rs. 22,000. The Income Tax Officer included the same in the income of the respon- dent-assessee relying upon the definition of 'income' in clause (24) of section 2. On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that inasmuch as the rally was not a race, the amount received cannot be treated as income within the meaning of section 2 (24) (ix). An appeal preferred by the Revenue was dismissed by the Tribunal. The Tribunal recorded the following findings: (a)That the said rally was not a race. It was predominantly a test of skill and endurance as well as of reliability of the vehicle.\n(b) That the rally was also not a 'game' within the meaning of section 2(24) (ix).\n(c) That the receipt in question was casual in nature. It was nevertheless not an income receipt and hence fell outside the provisions of section 10 (3) of the Act. 3. At the instance of the Revenue, the question aforementioned was stated for the opinion of the Madras High Court. The High Court held in favour of the assessee on the following reasoning: (a) The expression 'winnings' occuring at the inception of sub-clause (ix) in section 2(24) is distinct and different from the expression 'winning'. The expression 'winnings' has acquired a connotation of its own. It means money won by gambling or betting. The expression 'winnings' controls the meaning of several expressions occurring in the sub- clause. In this view of the matter, the sub-clause cannot take in the receipt concerned herein which was received by the assessee by participating in a race which involved skill in driving the vehicle. The rally was not a race. In other words the said receipt does not represent 'winnings'. \n(b) A perusal of the memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill,. 1 972, which inserted the said sub- clause in section 2(24), also shows that the idea behind the sub-clause was to rope in windfalls from lotteries, races and card games etc.(c) Section 74 (A) which too was introduced by the Finance Act, 1972 supports the said view. Section 74 (A) provides that any loss resulting from any of the sources mentioned therein can be set off against the income received from that source alone. The sources referred to in the said section are the very same sources mentioned in sub-clause (ix) of section 2(24) namely lotteries, crossword puzzles, races including horse races, card games etc. \nThe correctness of the view taken by the High Court is questioned herein. \nThe definition of 'income' in section 2(24) is an inclusive definition. The Parliament has been adding to the definition by adding sub-clause (s) from time to time. Sub- clause (ix) which was inserted by the Finance Act, 1972 reads as follows: \"(ix) any winnings from lotteries, crossword puzzles, races including horse races, card games and other games of any sort or from gambling or betting of any form or nature whatsoever;\" We may notice at this stage a provision in section IO. \nSection 10 occurs in chapter HI which carries the heading \"Incomes which do not form part of total income\". Section 10 in so far as is relevant reads thus: \" 10, Incomes not included in total income: In computing the total income of a previous year of any person, any income failing within any of the following clauses shall not be included: (d) any receipts which are of a casual and non recurring nature, not being winnings from lotteries, to the extent such receipts do not exceed one thousand rupees in the aggregate\". (The clause has been amended by Finance Act, 1986 but we are not concerned with it. Similarly it is not necessary to notice the proviso to the said clause.) It is not easy to define income. The definition in the Act is an inclusive one. As said by Lord Wright in Kamakshya Narayan Singh v. C.I.T. 11 I.TR. 513 P. C.\n\"income............. is a word difficult and perhaps impossible to define in any precise general formula. It is a word of the broadest connotation\". In Gopal Saran Narain Singh v. Commissioner of Income Tax 3.I.T.R. 237 P.C., the Privy Council pointed out that \"anything than can properly be described as income is taxable under the Act unless expressly exempted.\" This Court had to deal with the ambit of the expression 'income'in Navin Chandra Mafatlal v. C.I T.Bombay 26 I.T.R. (S.C.)The Indian Income-tax and Excess Profits Tax (Amendment) Act, 1947 had inserted section 12 (B) in the Indian Income- tax Act, 1922. Section 12(B) imposed a tax on capital gains. The validity of the said Amendment was questioned on the ground that tax on capital gains is not a tax on 'income'within the meaning of entry 54 of list-1, nor is it a tax on the capital value of the assets of individuals and companies within the meaning of entry-55, of list- 1 of the seventh schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935. The Bombay High Court repelled the attack. The matter was brought to this Court. After rejecting the argument on behalf of the assessee that the word 'income' has acquired, by legislative practice, a restricted meaning-and after affirming that the entries in the seventh schedule should receive the most liberal construction-the Court observed thus: \"What. then, is the ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning of the word \"income\"? According to the dictionary it means \"a thing that comes in.\" (See Oxford Dictionary, Vol. V,p. 162; Stroud, vol.II, pp. 14-16). In the United States of America and, in Australia both of which also are English speaking countries the word \"income is understood in a wide sense so as to include a capital gain. Reference may be made to- 'Eisner v. Macomber', [1919] 252 US 189 (K); -'Merchants' Loan and Trust Co. v.\n                         'Smietanka'[1920] 255 US 509 ( L) and -'United States of America v. Stewart', [1940] 311 US 60(M) and-'Resch v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation', [1943] 66 CLR 198 (N). In each of these cases very wide meaning was ascribed to the word \"income\" as its natural meaning. \nThe relevant observations of learned Judges deciding those cases which have been quoted in the judgment of Tendolkar J.\nquite clearly indicate that such wide meaning was put upon the word \"income\" not because of any particular legislative practice either in the United States or in the Commonwealth of Australia but because such was the normal concept and connotation of the ordinary English word \"income\". Its natural meaning embraces any profit or gain which is actually received. This is in consonance with the observations of Lord Wright to which reference has already been made. \nThe argument founded on an assumed legislative practice being thus out of the way, there can be no difficulty in applying its natural and grammatical meaning to the ordinary English word \"income'. As already observed, the word should be given its widest connota-tion in view of the fact that it occurs in a legislative head conferring legislative power. 8. Since the definition of income in section 2(24) is an inclusive one, its ambit, in our opinion, should be the same as that of the word income occurring in entry 82 of list 1 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution (corresponding to entry 54 of list 1 of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act).\n9. In Bhagwandas Jain v. Union of India 128 I.T.R. 315 S.C. The challenge was to the validity of section 23(2) of the Act which provided that where the property consists of house in the occupation of the owner for the purpose of his own residence, the annual value of such house shall first be determined in the same manner as if the property had been let and further be reduced by one half of the amount so determined or Rs. 1,800 whichever is less. The contention of the assessee was that he was not deriving any monetary benefit by residing in his own house and, therefore, no tax can be levied on him on the ground that he is deriving income from that house. It was contended that the word income means realisation of monetary benefit and that in the absence of any such realisation by the assessee, the conclusion of any amount by way of notional income under section 23(2) of the Act in the chargeable income was impermissible and outside the scope of entry 82 of list-1 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The said contention was rejected affirming that the expression income is of the widest amplitude and that it includes not merely what is received or what comes in by exploiting the use of the property but also that which can be converted into income. \n 10. Sub-clause (ix) of section 2(24) refers to lotteries, crossword puzzles, races including horse races, card games, other games of any sort and gambling or' betting of any form or nature whatsoever. All crossword puzzles are not of a gambling nature. Some are; some are not. See State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala A.I.R. 1957 S.C.699.Even in card games there are some games which are games of skill without an element of gamble (See State of Andhra Pradesh v.K. Satyanarayan[1968] 2 S.C.R. 515. The words other games of any sort\" are of wide amplitude. Their meaning is not confined to games of a gambling nature alone. It thus appears that sub-clause (ix) is not confined to mere gambling or betting activities. But, says the High Court, the meaning of all. the aforesaid words is controlled by the word 'winnings' occurring at the inception of the subclause. \nThe High Court says, relying upon certain material, that the expression winnings' has come to acquire a particular meaning viz, receipts from activities of a gambling or betting nature alone. Assuming that the High Court is right in its interpretation of the expression 'winnings', does it follow that merely becausewinnings from gambling/betting activities are included within the ambit of income,the monies received from non- gambling and non-betting activities are not so included? \nWhat is the implication flowing from insertion of clause (ix)? If the monies which are not earned-in the true sense of the word-constitute income why do moneies earned by skill and toil not constitute income? Would it not look odd. if one is to say that monies received from games and races of gambling nature represent income but not those received from games and races of non-gambling nature? The rally in question was a contest, if not a race. The respondent- assessee entered the contest to win it and to win the first prize. What he got was a return' for his skill and endurance. Then why is it not income-which expression must be construed in its widest sense. Further, even if a receipt does not fall within subclause (ix), or for that matter, any of the sub-clauses in section 2(24), it may yet constitute income. To say otherwise, would mean reading the several clauses in section 2(24) as exhaustive of the meaning of 'income' when the Statute expressly says that it is inclusive. It would be a wrong approach to try to place a given receipt under one or the other sub-clauses in section 2(24) and if it does not fall under any of the sub- clauses, to say that it does not constitute income. Even if a receipt does not fall within the ambit of any of the sub- clauses in section 2(24), it may still be income if it partakes of the nature of the income. The idea behind providing inclusive definition in section 2(24) is not to limit its meaning but to widen its net. This Court has repeatedly said that the word 'income' is of widest amplitude, and that it must be given its natural and grammatical meaning. Judging from the above standpoint, the receipt concerned herein is also income. May be it is causal in nature but it is income nevertheless. That even the casual income is 'income' is evident from section 10 (3). Section 10 seeks to exempt certain 'incomes' from being included in the total income'. A casual receipt which should mean, in the context, casual income is liable to be included in the total income if it is in excess of Rs.\n1,000, by virtue of clause (3) of section 10. Even though it is a clause exempting a particular receipt/income to a limited extent, it is yet relevant on the meaning of the expression 'income'. In our respectful opinion, the High Court, having found that the receipt in question does not fall within sub-clause (ix) of section 2(24), erred in concluding that it does not constitute income. The High Court has read the several sub-clauses in section 2(24) as exhaustive of the definition of income when in fact it is not so. In this connection it is relevant to notice the finding of the Tribunal. It found that the receipt in question was casual in nature but-it opined-it was nevertheless not an income receipt and fell outside the provision of section 10 (3) of the Act. We have found it difficult to follow the logic behind the argument. 11. For the above reasons we hold that the receipt in question herein doesconstitute 'income' as defined in clause (24) of section 2 of the Act. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the question referred by the Tribunal under section 256(1) of the Act is answered in the negative i.e., in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee. There shall be no order as to costs. \nRSK.\nAppeal allowed.",

It was alleged that the appellants had without\nreasonable cause obstructed the officers of the Bank from\nlawfully entering the premises of the branch of the Bank and\nhad obstructed the transactions of normal business. After\ntrial the appellants were acquitted. The respondent-Bank filed an appeal against the\njudgment of acquittal before the High Court, which was\ndisposed of after nearly six years.

Ramaswami Naicker &\nOrs., [1959] S.C.R. 1211, relied upon. \n\nJUDGMENT: \n         CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Criminal Appeal No.848 of 1985. From the Judgment and Order dated 19.12.1984 of the Calcutta High Court in Crl. A. No. 315 of 1978. \n         D.N. Mukharjee and P.K. Chakravorty for the Appellants. \n         U.R. Lalit, V.N. Koura and Ashok Grover for the Respondent. \n         The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, J. This appeal by special leave is filed by the appellants against the judgment and order dated December 19, 1984 in Criminal Appeal No. 315 of 1978 on the file of the Calcutta High Court setting aside the judgment of acquittal passed in C-3064 of 1977 on the file of the Metropolitan Magistrate, 12th Court, Calcutta. \n This appeal arises out of a complaint filed before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Calcutta by one Manindra Narayan Choudhury, Operation Manager of the Grindlays Bank Ltd. against the twelve appellants, referred to above, for offences punishable under section 341, Indian Penal Code and section 36AD of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 said to have been committed by them on October 31, 1977. The complaint alleged that the appellants had without reasonable cause obstructed the officers of the Bank, particularly Shri G. Vaidya from lawfully entering the premises of the branch of the Bank at 41, Chowringhee Road, Calcutta and had obstructed the transaction of normal business at the saidbranch. It was also alleged that they had thereby committed the offence punishable under section 147, Indian Penal Code. \nThe prosecution further alleged that all of them were constructively liable for the offences said to have been committed by them under section 34, Indian Penal Code. It was urged that these acts had been committed by the appellants pursuant to a call of strike given by the employees of the Bank. The Magistrate issued summons to the appellants for offences punishable under section 341, Indian Penal Code and under section 36AD, of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. After trial, the Magistrate by his judgment dated June 27, 1978 acquitted all the appellants. Against the said judgment of acquittal an appeal was filed by the Grindlays Bank Ltd. before the High Court of Calcutta in Criminal Appeal No. 315 of 1978. The said appeal came to be disposed of after nearly six years on December 19, 1984. The High Court felt that the trial court had missed the essence of the offences with which the appellants had been charged and therefore there was failure of justice. Hence it set aside the judgment of acquittal passed by the Magistrate and remanded the case for retrial for offences punishable under section 341 read with section 34 or section 149, Indian Penal Code. Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the appellants have filed this appeal. After going through the judgment of the Magistrate and of the High Court we feel that whatever might have been the error committed by the Magistrate, in the circumstances of the case, it was not just and proper for the High Court to have remanded the case for fresh trial, when the order of acquittal had been passed nearly six years before the judgment of High Court. The pendency of the Criminal Appeal for six years before the High Court is itself a regrettable feature of this case. In addition to it, the order directing retrial has resulted in serious prejudice to the appellants. \nWe are of the view that having regard to the nature of the acts alleged to have been committed by the appellants and other attendant circumstances, this was a case in which the High Court should have directed the dropping of the proceedings in exercise of its inherent powers under section 482, Criminal Procedure Code even if for some reason on it came to the conclusion that the acquittal was wrong. A fresh trial nearly seven years after the alleged incident is bound to result in harassment and abuse of judicial process. We may at this state refer to the decision of this Court in S.\nVeerabadran Chettiar v. E. V. Ramswami Nacker & Ors. , [1959] S.C.R. 1211. In that case this Court disagreed with the High Court on the interpretation of section 295 of the Indian Penal Code and the order of dismissal of complaint by the Courts below, but it proceeded to observe at page 1218 thus : \"But the question still remains whether, even after expressing our strong disagreement with the interpretation of the section by the courts below, this Court should direct a further inquiry into the complaint, which has stood dismissed for the last about 5 years. The action complained of against the accused persons, if true, was foolish, to put if mildly, but as the case has become stale, we do not direct further inquiry into this complaint. If there is a recurrence of such a foolish behaviour on the part of any section of the community, we have no doubt that those charged with the duty of maintaining law and order, will apply the law in the sense in which we have interpreted the law. The appeal is therefore, dismissed.\" \n         We are of the view that following the above principle the High Court should have dismissed the appeal before it even if it disagreed with the view taken by the trial court with regard to the gist of the offence punishable under section 341 Indian Penal Code, having regard to the inordinate delay of nearly six years that had ensued after the judgment of acquittal, the nature and magnitude of the offences alleged to have been committed by the appellants and the difficulties that may have to be encountered in securing the presence of witnesses in a case of this nature nearly 7 years after the incident. The termination of the criminal proceedings in that way would secure the ends of justice as it would bring about reconciliation between the management and the employees and also put an end to a stale criminal proceedings in which the public had no longer sufficient interest. We accordingly set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the order of acquittal passed in this case by the Metropolitan Magistrate without however expressing any opinion on the issues of facts and law involved in the case. \n The appeal is accordingly allowed.  Appeal allowed. A.P.J.",

The brief facts of the case of the prosecution are that:- The complainant and accused No.1 married on 09.07.2009 before the Sub-Registrar at Mysuru and thereafter the said marriage was performed before the elders on 20.09.2010 at Kendaganneshwara temple. It is alleged in the complaint that the accused demanded for Rs.10,00,000/- and gold ornaments. The parents of the complainant gave Rs.10,00,000/- and other gold ornaments as per the demand. \nIt is alleged that the accused No.1 to 3 started harassing the complainant for one or the other reason. The accused abused the complainant in filthy language. The complainant has alleged that the accused subjected her for physical assault. \nThe accused demanded for further dowry amount from the complainant. Even after receipt of Rs.2,00,000/- after the marriage the accused did not bother to take care of the complainant. It is also alleged that the accused demanded money for the purchase of Zen Car. The accused used to come to the place of work of the complainant and pick up quarrel with her. The complainant was driven out of the house and the gold and silver articles and the amount which was received as dowry by the accused was not returned to the complainant. Hence the complaint is lodged by the complainant against the accused No.1 to 4 before the concerned police. CW.12 has registered the case against the accused. CW.13 has further conducted the investigation and filed the charge sheet against the accused No.1 to 4 for offences punishable U/s.498(A) R/w section 34 of I.P.C. and Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. \n 3. The accused No.1 to 4 are on Court bail. The charge framed, read over and explained to the accused. After understanding the charge the accused denied the same and claimed to be tried. \n 4. The prosecution has examined PW.1 to 3 and the documents are marked as Ex.P1 to P4. As there is no incriminating evidence against the accused, the statement of accused U/s.313 of Cr.P.C. is dispensed with. \n 5. Heard arguments of Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor and counsel for accused. 6. The points that emerge for consideration are:- 1) Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused No.1 being the husband of CW.1 in furtherance of common intention has ill treated the complainant and the accused No.1 to 3 started harassing the complainant and abused the complainant in filthy language and he subjected her for physical assault also even after receipt of Rs.2,00,000/- after the marriage the accused did not bother to take care of the complainant and the accused used to come to the place of work of the complainant and pick up quarrel with her, the complainant was driven out of the house and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 498(A) R/w section 34 of I.P.C.? \n 2) Whether the prosecution further proves beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of marriage, the accused demanded for Rs.10,00,000/- and gold ornaments and the parents of the complainant gave Rs.10,00,000/- and other gold ornaments as per the demand and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3 of Dowry Prohibition Act? \n 3) Whether the prosecution further proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused harassed the complainant physically and mentally in demand of money and Even after receipt of Rs.2,00,000/- after the marriage the accused did not bother to take care of the complainant and the accused demanded money for the purchase of Zen Car and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act? \n 4) What Order? \n 7. Perused oral and documentary evidence placed on record.  Having heard, the answer to above points are:- Point No. 1 :  In the Negative Point No. 2 : Point No. 3 :  In the Negative Point No. 4 : In the Negative As per final order below, for the following : R E A S O N S : 8. POINT No.1 TO 3 :- The complainant, Smt. Nayana and her parents are examined on behalf of the prosecution as PW.1 to 3. \n 9. The contents of the complaint are that the complainant and the accused No.1 married on 09.07.2009 before the Sub-Registrar, Mysuru and thereafter the marriage was performed before the elders on 20.09.2010. It is alleged in the complaint that the complainant was tortured physically and mentally in demand of money by the accused No.1 to 4.\n The accused demanded for money to open a shop and a Gym center. Even after compliance of the dowwry the accused harassed the complainant. The accused demanded for Zen Car. The accused also caused harassment to the complainant in her work place. The evidence of PW.1 is totally contrary to the complaint. PW.1 has not deposed in accordance with the contents of the complaint. When the complainant turned hostile and not supported the case of the prosecution she was cross examined by the learned APP. 10. The PW.1 has admitted during the cross examination about the compromise held in between the complainant and the accused. \n 11. PW.2 Sri. Girigowda is the father of the complainant who turned hostile and not supported the case of the prosecution. \n 11. PW.3 Smt. Pramila is the mother of the complainant who turned hostile and not supported the case of the prosecution. \n 12. The learned APP prayed to issue summons to the other witnesses, but no purpose will be served in examining the other witnesses in view of the oral evidence given by the complainant before the Court of law. Hence, the prayer of learned APP was rejected and the case of the prosecution was closed. As there was no incriminating evidence the statement of accused U/s.313 of Cr.P.C. is also dispensed with. \n 13. As per Sec.498(A) of I.P.C. husband or the relative of the husband who cause any ill treatment to the aggrieved woman are liable for the alleged offences. But in view of the evidence of PW.1 to 3, the contents of the complaint are not supported. Therefore, the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused No.1 to 4 U/s.498(A) R/w section 34 of I.P.C., Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. Therefore, the accused No.1 to 4 are entitle for acquittal. Hence, I answer Point No.1 to 5 in the Negative. \n 14. POINT No.6 : - In the result I proceed to pass the following : :: O R D E R :: Acting U/s.248(1) of Cr.P.C. the accused No.1 to 4 are acquitted for the offences punishable under sections 498(A) R/w section 34 of I.P.C. and section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.\n                            The bail bonds of the accused No.1 to 4 and their sureties stand cancelled.

Lava, Advocates\n                           . . . . This I.T.A. is filed under Section 260A of the\nIncome Tax Act, 1961, arising out of order dated\n30.06.2008 passed in IT(SS)A No.129/BNG/2004, for\nthe Assessment year 01.04.1990 to 10.11.2000, praying\nto:\n\n        (i) formulate the substantial questions of law\n              stated therein,\n\n        (ii) Allow the appeal and set-aside the order\n              passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,\n              Bangalore in IT(SS)A No.129/BNG/2004,\n              dated 30.06.2008 and confirm the order\n              passed by Assessing Authority in the interest\n              of justice.\n\n         This I.T.A. coming on for hearing, this day,\nN.Kumar J., delivered the following:\n\n                             JUDGMENT \n The Revenue has preferred this appeal against the order passed by the Tribunal, which has set-aside the order passed by the Lower Authorities on the ground that the undisclosed income is to be assessed in the hands of the HUF, insofar as the lottery business is concerned and insofar as the finance business is concerned, it is to be assessed as AOP under the name Easy Finance and not under the name of the assessee in his individual capacity.\n 2. The assessee is doing lottery business under the trade name M/s. Luck Associates, Mangalore. He is also running unregistered finance business under the name and style of Easy Finance. A search as conducted on 10.11.2000 and a cash of Rs.8,00,000/- was seized and gold jewellery weighing 430 grams was found. The assessee in his statement stated that the main stockists of lottery were M/s.Pooja Agencies and M/s. Ganesh Agencies of Delhi, M/s. Sri Laxmi Venkatesh Lottery, Mangalore and M/s. M & Co., Bangalore. The Assessing Authority passed an order on 29.11.2002 under Section 158BC read with Section 143(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short, hereinafter referred to as `the Act'). The Assessing Authority did not accept the case of the assessee and held that the undisclosed income offered has to be assessed in the name of the assessee in his individual capacity in respect of both lottery business and finance business. Aggrieved by the said order, the assessee preferred an appeal to the Commissioner of Income-tax(Appeals), who affirmed the said order. \nThereafter, the Assessee preferred a second appeal to the Tribunal. \n 3. The Tribunal, on consideration of the entire material on record took note of the fact that the assessee's father by name Harshad Rai Pajwani has got HUF registered under the provisions of the Sales tax on 02.08.1999. However, he died on 16.10.1999. \nThereafter, the son carried on the said lottery business as kartha of the HUF. Therefore, the Tribunal was of the view that the authorities were not justified in assessing the undisclosed income relatable to the lottery business in the hands of the individual, but it ought to be assessed in the hands of the HUF. Insofar as the finance business is concerned, it was done under the name of Easy Finance. The seized materials, show the names of Prakash, Rajesh and Jagadish, who are the members of the association. In fact the notice was issued to AOP. In those circumstances, the Tribunal was of the view that even the undisclosed income relating to the finance business have to be assessed in the hands of AOP and not in the hands of the assessee, in his individual capacity. Accordingly, it allowed the appeal, set-aside the impugned orders and accepted the case of the assessee. \n 4. Aggrieved by the said order, the Revenue is in appeal. This appeal was admitted to consider the following substantial questions of law: (i) Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the Tribunal was right in deleting the addition of income from lottery business in the hands of the assessee treating it as HUF's income and not the assessee on the basis of the Sales Tax Returns filed?\n (ii) Whether the Tribunal was right in deleting the addition made representing the assessed income from finance business by holding that it represented the income of AOP solely on the basis of investment made in finance business when factually no AOP existed? 5. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. 6. Insofar as the first substantial question of law is concerned, whether the undisclosed income relatable to, particularly the lottery business, is to be assessed in the hands of the individual or HUF, is purely a question of fact. The Tribunal has taken note of the undisputed fact that the father of the assessee got registered the HUF under the provisions of the Sales Tax on 02.08.1999, which is not in dispute. It shows that the father wanted to do lottery business as HUF. \nUnfortunately, within two months there from, that is on 16.10.1999, the father died. It is the case of the assessee that he continued the said business as the Kartha of the HUF. The reason given by the Lower Authorities to come to the conclusion that the amount is to be assessed in the hands of the assessee as an individual instead of HUF is that the HUF did not have money to invest in this business as they have not maintained any accounts. The said inference drawn by the assessing authority is without any basis. As is clear from the aforesaid facts, the sales tax registration was done on 02.08.1999 and within two months, the father died. Therefore, the question of the father maintaining the books of accounts, would not arise. After the death of the father, the son is carrying on with the said business. If he had maintained the accounts and if he had disclosed all the amounts in the accounts, it seems that it would not have been treated as undisclosed income. It is because books were not maintained and returns were not filed, the authorities laid their hands on the undisclosed income. Therefore, the Tribunal was justified in the facts of the case in holding that the said amount is to be assessed in the hands of the HUF in the aforesaid circumstances and not in the hands of the assessee in his individual capacity. In fact during such proceedings, the assessee had requested the authorities to adjust this undisclosed income and seized cash as advance tax for HUF and therefore, we do not find any infirmity in the order passed by the Tribunal, which calls for interference. Hence, we answer the first substantial question of law in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue. \n 7. Insofar as the second substantial question of law is concerned, it is not in dispute that the seized materials disclose the names of the three persons namely, Manish, Jagadish and Rajesh. They were carrying on the finance business under the name and style of `Easy Finance' as Association of Persons. \n 8. In fact the notice under Section 158BC of the Act was issued in the capacity as AOP only on 08.11.2002. Even before issue of that notice, returns had been filed in the status of AOP and the tax had been paid. The returns filed by the assessee on 24th August, 2001 for all the three years from 1999-2000, 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 shows undisclosed income as Nil. In the light of the aforesaid evidence on record the undisclosed income relatable to the finance business is to be assessed in the hands of the AOP and not as an individual. Thus, second substantial question of law is answered in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue. \n 9. For the aforesaid reasons, we do not see any merit in this appeal. Appeal is dismissed. \n Sd/- JUDGE Sd/- JUDGE SPS",

The Commercial\nTax Officer disallowed the claim holding that as subsequent\ndisposal had not been proved, it was liable to be taxed as a\nlast purchase. The Assistant Commissioner upheld the order,\nbut the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal accepted the assessee's \nclaim . The Department's revision to the High Court was\ndismissed. In to this Court,\nHELD : The assessee was not liable till the purchase of\ndeclared goods acquired the character of a last purchase\nwithin the Second Schedule of the Act. It is true that Ss.\n3 and 4 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, speak of \"a\nyear\", i.e., the financial year, and it is only the turnover\nduring that year that is liable to taxation in the hands of\nthe assessee, but s. 4 has to be read with the Second\nSchedule, and reading s. 4 with the Second Schedule, it is \nclear that a dealer is not liable to pay a tax on the\npurchases until the Purchases acquire ,the quality of being\nlast purchases inside the State . In, other words, when he\nfiles a return and declares the stock in hand, the stock in\nhand cannot be said to have been acquired by last purchase\nbecause he may still during the next assessment year, sell\nit or he may consume it himself or the goods may be\ndestroyed, etc. He would be entitled to claim before the\nassessing authorities that the character of acquisition of\nthe stock in hand was undetermined; in the light of\nsubsequent events it may or may not become the last purchase\ninside the State.

Commercial Tax Of 113 S.T.C. 773,\nreferred to. \n\nJUDGMENT: \n CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeals No. s. 633 & 634 of 1966.\n Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated August 11, 1964 of the Madras High Court in Tax Cases Nos.\n 105 and 125 of 1963 (Revision Nos. 64 and 81). \n G. Ramanujam and A. V. Rangam, for the appellant (in both the appeals. \n S. T. Desai and G. L. Sanghi, for the respondents (in both the appeals). \n The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri, J. These appeals by special leave are directed against the judgment of the Madras High Court in Tax Cases Nos. 105 and 125 of 1963. The High Court by its common judgment dated August 11, 1964, confirmed the, orders of the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal. A common point of law is involved in both the cases and it will suffice if we give facts in Tax Case No. 105 of 1963 (Civil Appeal Nos. 633 of 1966) in which the respondent was one T. Narayanaswami Naidu, hereinafter referred to as the assessee. The assessee is a dealer in cotton and cotton seeds. Before the Additional Commercial Tax Officer, Coimbatore, he claimed to deduct the sum of Rs. 12,32,756.45 as the value of purchases other than the last purchases of cotton. The Commercial Tax Officer exempted Rs.\n 10,11,534.40 but disallowed the remaining amount on the ground that cotton worth Rs. 2,27,250.00 was in stock on March 31, 1961. He found that subsequent disposal in the next year had not been proved and, therefore, it was liable to be taxed as a last purchase. In holding this he followed the decision of the Kerala High Court in Abdulsalam Rowther v. State of Kerala(1). The Appellate Assistant Commissioner (Commercial Taxes) upheld the order, but the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, dissenting from the decision of the Kerala High Court, in Abdulsalam Rowther v. State of Kerala(1), accepted the appeal of the assessee and demanded the ease to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner for disposal afresh in the light of observations made by it. \n The Department filed a revision under s. 38 of tile Madras General Sales Tax Act, hereinafter referred to as the Madras Act, and the High Court dismissed the revision. The State of Madras having obtained special leave, the appeal is now before us. The learned counsel for the appellant, Mr. Ramanujam, urges that the decision of the Kerala High Court in Abdulsalam Rowthel v. State of Kerala,(1) and of the Mysore High Court in Hornusji Hirjibhoy v. Conmmercial Tax Officer(2) laid down the law correctly, and the Madras High Court erred in dissenting from these decisions in the present case (now reported as State of Madras v.  T.              Narayanaswami Naidu(3).\n Section 4 of the Madras Act provides \" 4. Notwithstanding anything contained in section 3, the tax under this Act shall be payable by a dealer on the sale or purchase inside the State of declared goods at the rate and only at the point specified against each in the Second Schedule on the turnover in such goods in each year, whatever be the quantum of turnover in that year.\" \n In other words, this section lays down that in respect of declared goods we have to look at the Second Schedule in order to find (1) 12 S.T.C. 98.\n(3) 16 S.T.C. 29.\n(2) 13 S.T.C. 773.,out the point at which the tax would be payable by the dealer. The Second Schedule describes the declared goods in respect of which a single point tax only is leviable under s. 4. Item 2 of the Second Schedule is \"Cotton, that is to say, all kinds of cotton (indigenous or imported) in its unmanufactured state, whether ginned or unginned, baled, pressed or otherwise, but excluding cotton waste\". The point of levy is stated as \"at the point of last purchase in the State\". \nThe question that arises is : what is the exact meaning of the expression \"at the point of last purchase in the State\"\n? In this connection it may be mentioned that S. 14 of the Central Sales lax Act, 1956, hereinafter referred to as the Central Act, declares certain goods as of special importance in inter-State trade and commerce, and cotton is one of the goods included in s. 14. Section 15 provides : \"15. Every sales tax law of a State shall, in so far as it imposes or authorises the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of declared goods, be subject to the following restrictions and conditions, namely :- (a) the tax payable under that law in respect of any sale or purchase of such goods inside the State shall not exceed two per cent. of the sale or purchase price thereof, and such tax shall not be levied at more than one stage;\" \nSection 4 of the Madras Act was intended to comply with s.\n15 of the Central Act. The relevant portion of s. 3 of the Madras Act, on which. the learned counsel for the appellant relies, provides : 3(1) Every dealer (other than a casual trader or agent of a non-resident dealer) whose total turnover for a year is not less than ten thousand rupees and every casual trader or agent of a non-resident dealer, whatever be his turnover for the year, shall pay a tax for each year at the rate of two per cent of his taxable turnover I\"\nSection 2(p). defines \"taxable turnover\" to mean \"the turnover on which a dealer shall be liable to pay tax as determined after making such deductions from his total turnover and in such manner as may be prescribed\", and \"year\" is defined to mean \"financial year\". \"Turnover\" is defined in S. 2(r) as follows \"'turnover' means the aggregate amount for which goods are bought or sold, or supplied or distributed, by a dealer, either directly or through another, on his                         own account or on account of others whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration, provided that the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce, other than tea, grown within the State by himself or on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner, usufructuary mortgagee, tenant or otherwise. shall be excluded from his turnover;...... The learned counsel for the appellant says that it is clear from ss. 3 and 4 that a tax under the Madras Act is a yearly tax. In other words, he says, that just as under the, Indian Income Tax Act each assessment year is a self- contained unit, so is the assessment year a self-contained unit under the Madras Act. If that is so, he argues, then what happens in subsequent year-., cannot be taken into consideration for determining the taxability of any purchase inside the State of declared goods. He says that the taxable event is the last purchase in the State during the assessment year and if stocks are held at the end of the assessment year it follows that the assessee holding the stocks is the last purchaser in the State. \nIn our opinion, this reasoning is fallacious. It is true that ss. 3 and 4 speak of \"a year\", i.e., the financial year, and it is only the turnover during that year that is liable to taxation in the hands of the assessee, but s. 4 has to be read with the Second Schedule, and reading s. 4 with the Second Schedule, it seems to us clear that a dealer is not liable to pay a tax on the purchases until the purchases acquire the quality of being the last purchases inside the State. In other words, when he files a return and declares the stock in hand, the stock in hand cannot be said to have been acquired by last purchase because he may still during the next assessment year,, sell it or he may consume it himself or the goods may be destroyed, etc. He would be entitled to claim before the assessing authorities that the character of acquisition of the stock in hand was undetermined; in the light of subsequent events it may or may not become The last purchase inside the State. \nIn our view this construction is in consonance with s. 15 of the Central Act. If the argument of the learned counsel for the State were to be accepted it would mean that the States could with impunity levy purchase tax on declared goods at more than one stage, i.e. on purchases in the hands of one dealer during one assessment year and purchases of the same goods in the hands of another dealer in a subsequent assessment year, and so on. Therefore, we agree with the Madras High Court that the assessee is right in contending that he was entitled to claim deduction in respect of the value of the stock of Rs. 2,27,250 as being the purchases other than last purchases of cotton. \nL7 Sup. Cl/67-1 0The Kerala High Court in Abdulsalam Rowther v. State of Kerala(1), following certain cases decided under the Income Tax Act, was influenced by the consideration that an assessee could not rely on subsequent events in order to escape taxation' That may be so even under the Sales Tax Act, but, according to our view, the assessee is not liable till the purchase of declared goods acquires the character of a last purchase within the Second Schedule referred to above. In Hornusji Hirjibhoy v. Commercial Tax Officer(1) the Mysore High Court also seems to have been impressed by similar considerations. \nThe judgment under appeal draws a distinction between tax- able event and a stage at which the levy of tax in the case of declared goods is subject to single point levy. This may cause confusion, and indeed, the High Court gives one illustration, which it found unnecessary to deal with. The illustration given is : \"One can visualise a case for example, where goods mentioned above purchased on the 30th of March, 1960 may be exported by the purchaser himself, outside the State, on the 2nd of April, 1960. In that case the goods could not be assessed in 1960-61 in the hands of the exporting purchaser, because the taxable event did not occur in that year; it could not be assessed in the hands of the seller in 1959-60 because though the taxable event occurred that year, the single point stage was not reached in that year. One possible way of dealing with such a case is to assess it subsequently as escaped turnover.\"\n  In our opinion, in this illustration, the assessee would be liable in the financial year 1960-61 as the purchases became the last purchases in that year. \n In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.\n  The facts in Tax Case No. 125 of 1963 (Civil Appeal No. 634 of 1966) are similar. That appeal is also dismissed with costs. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner (Commercial Taxes) will now dispose of the cases remanded to him by the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal in the light of the judgment. \n Y.P.                               Appeal dismissed. \n (1) 12 S.T.C. 99.\n (2) 13 S.T.C. 773.\n ",

Civil Judge (Jr. Dn.), Mysore vide Judgment and decree dated 09.08.2007.\n2. The parties are referred as per their original rank before the trial court for the sake of convenience. 3. It is the plaintiff's case that he belongs to lingayath community and a Hindu by religion. On 07.03.1990, he married Annapurna according to Hindu customs and traditions and has two Kum.Shushma and Karthik in the said wed lock. \nThe mother of the defendants filed C.Mis.135/2000 U/s 125 Cr.P.C., before the Family Court at Mysore seeking maintenance from him. The family court gave a specific finding that the mother of the defendants is not his legally wedded wife of the plaintiff, but he was ordered to pay maintenance to the defendants herein. His revision before the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in RPFC No.8/2004 came to be dismissed with an observation that the order passed by the Family court is interim in nature and would be in force till a declaration is given by a competent civil court. \nLeft with no other alternative, he filed this suit for declaration and injunction. 4. The defendants represented by their mother contend in the written statement that their mother Sabeena Parveen is the legally wedded wife of the plaintiff and they are born to the plaintiff in the said wed lock. In C.Mis.135/2000 it is held that they are the children of the plaintiff born to Sabina Parveen. \nThe Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka has also upheld the decision of the Family Court. To forestall the recovery proceedings, the plaintiff has filed this suit, on frivolous grounds. The plaintiff had married Sabeena Parveen according to Hindu Customs on 21.03.1988 at Ganesha temple, Mysore by exchanging garlands and tying Mangalasutra. The plaintiff developed bad habits after the birth of 1st defendant and used to beat Sabeena Parveen; he even intentionally deserted them. He threw Sabeen Parveen from the matrimonial home after she refused to give him divorce. \n 5. Basing on the above pleadings, the Trial Court has framed the following: ISSUES 1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled for declaration to the effect that there is no relation of father and children between the plaintiff and the defendants? \n 2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of permanent injunction restraining the defendants from enforcing the order passed by the Hon'ble Judge, Family Court, Mysore in C.Mis No.135/2000 dated 10.12.2003? \n 3. Whether this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit? \n 4. What order or decree? 6. The plaintiff and his three witnesses have been examined as PW1 to PW4; Ex.P1 to Ex.P18 and Ex.P4(a), Ex.P6(a) have been marked for the plaintiff. The defendants' mother and natural guardian has examined herself as DW1 and got marked Ex.D1 to Ex.D12.\n 7. After considering all the materials placed on record and the evidence adduced by the parties, the trial court dismissed the suit by judgment and decree dated 09.08.2007. Aggrieved by the same, the plaintiff has preferred this appeal on the following amongst other grounds: That the Trial Court has failed to appreciate the oral and documentary evidence adduced by him in proper perspective; Ex.P3 has been rejected on some flimsy grounds and the Trial court failed to note that DW1 is not an illiterate lady and she had attested her signature in English. The evidence of PW2 is also not appreciated properly. The Trial Court erred in relying upon Ex.P15, P17 and Ex.P18 in as much as particulars therein are not given by him. \n 8. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has filed written arguments. I have gone through the same carefully and thoroughly. I have also given my anxious consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned Counsel for the appellant and also the respondents. I have carefully gone through the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties before the Trial Court. \n 9. The points that arise for my consideration are: 1. Whether the findings of the Trial Court on issue No.1 is just and sustainable?\n 2. Whether impugned Judgment and decree calls for interference? \n 3. What order? \n 10. My findings on the above Points are: Point No.1: In the Affirmative. \nPoint No.2: In the Negative. Point No.3: As per final order for following REASONS 11. Point No.1: The Learned Counsel appearing for the appellant vehemently canvassed that the plaintiff who is a Lingayath is married to Annapurna and has got two children in the said wed lock. The Family Court while disposing of the C.Mis. filed by the defendants' mother held that the she is not the legally wedded wife of the plaintiff. The Trail Court erred in not properly appreciating Ex.P3 sworn to by DW1 and produced before the school authorities seeking change of the defendants' father's name as `Yusuf' in the place of Suresh. DNA test was not done to confirm the paternity. 12. Per contra, the Learned Counsel for the respondents supported the judgment and decree of the Trial Court. It was contended by him that since the plaintiff has not chosen to assail the judgment in RPFC 8/2004, the finding that the defendants are the children of the plaintiff has become final. In Ex.P3, a printed Form there is a huge blank space between the typed matter and DW1's signature, which is not even identified by anybody. Merely because the signature is affixed in English it cannot be presumed that DW1 is a literate. Ex.P3 is a concocted document. \n 13. In the light of the above rival contentions, if the evidence on record is carefully examined, it is seen that, the question whether PW1 is married to Annapurna and has children through her is irrelevant for the purpose of this case. The trial court thus has rightly held that the Ex.P7 to Ex.P13 are not material to the matter in issue. \n 14. Further, the findings of the Family Court in C.Mis.135/00 that the mother of the defendants is not the legally wedded wife of the plaintiff has reached finality, as the said order is confirmed by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka, in RPFC No.8/2004. Further no relief is claimed against her in the suit filed by the plaintiff. \n 15. The only issue that requires to be considered is whether the defendants are the children of the plaintiff or not? The plaintiff to discharge the burden cast upon him, relies mainly on Ex.P3 which is an affidavit sworn to by Sabeena Parveen for change of her husband's name in the school records Yousuf on the ground that it is wrongly entered as Suresh in respect of her daughter Fathimmunnisa. \n 16. On perusal of Ex.P3 it is seen that there is a huge gap between the typed portion and DW1's signature which is not even identified by any Advocate. Ex.P3 is said to have been sworn to before certain S.Sundararaja Iyengar, a Notary on 24.7.1997. DW1 categorically states that the plaintiff admitted Fathimunnisa to C.K.C.Convent and that she has not appeared before any Notary on 24.07.1997.\n 17. No doubt Ex.P6, report of the expert commissioner is to the effect that the signature of DW1 on Ex.P3 is the same as the one found on the vakalathnama and the written statement filed by DW1 on behalf of minor defendants in this case. \nDW1 specifically states that the name of the first defendant's father as seen in the birth certificate Ex.P5 was entered as instructed by the plaintiff. \n 18. Ex.D1 is the Certificate issued by Christ Convent, 30.1.2003 to the effect that the 1st defendant is the daughter of G.Suresh i.e., the plaintiff and that she is a student of their Institution; her date of birth is 15.9.1990 as per the school records. Ex.D9 is the Antenatal Card issued by the Dr.B.Nirmala, a Consultant Gynecologist wherein DW1's husband's name is shown as Suresh. DW1 has stated that this document pertains to the 1st defendant. 19. Ex .D10 is the birth certificate in respect of the 1st defendant wherein the name of her parents is shown as Suresh and Sabeena. Ex.D11 is the voters list extract obtained on 3.3.94 wherein the plaintiff and DW1 are shown as husband and wife. DW1 claims that the plaintiff at the relevant point of time furnished these particulars. \n 20. PW1 pleads ignorance to the suggestion that the 2nd defendant Hazira was born while he was living with DW1 in Vivekanandanagara. He also claims to be not knowing the contents of Ex.P3 and if the signature thereon is not made by DW1. PW1 says that he does not know who handed over Ex.P3 to School authorities. \n 21. PW2, H.M. of C K C Convent unequivocally admits that in Ex.P2, the 1st defendant's father's name is entered as G.Suresh and even in the application submitted at the time of her admission it was mentioned so. According to PW2 only during 2004, on the basis of Ex.P3 she has struck off `Suresh' in Ex.P5 and changed it as `Yusuf' that after the plaintiff brought filing of such affidavit to her knowledge. The relevant portion of PW2's evidence reads as under: \"zj Cqm 2004 g  UģP    ýzU Agvz. .B13.1.2005 gAz Ai zj AiĪ  UģP vAgvg. -3 C U Aiig vAz Pngvg JAz U Uwۮ. zj wzݥr iqĪ Aiz  zj  wzݥr AiĪ 1 wUU Cx          Cg  vAi UģPU  vg. .3 C x jU  PýzU rzã.\"\n 22. Further PW2 states that she does not know who effected corrections in Ex.P6, which was admittedly, issued on 10.4.2000 much prior to PW2 noticing Ex.P3. How the plaintiff came to know about existence of Ex.P3? remains unanswered. \n 23. Ex.D5 is NCR issued by the SHO of Ashokapuram Police Station, Mysore to DW1 in respect of a complaint against her husband Suresha. Ex.D8 is the endorsement issued on 1.7.2000, with respect to this complaint. If at all the plaintiff was not at all known to DW1 as claimed, how DW1 could give his name as her husband's name or lodge a complaint against him as early as in 1990 and year 2000 has also remained unanswered. \n 24. On perusal Ex.P14, it is seen that the Family Court had held that the plaintiff herein and DW1 though were residing together as husband and wife, yet DW1 could not be his legally wedded wife on account of the fact that she had remained a Muslim. This finding has not bee set aside, varied or modified by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in RPFC. No.8/2004. Therefore the same has reached finality. \n 25. The evidence on record indicates that PW2 on being prompted by the plaintiff has struck off the plaintiff's name appearing in the 1st defendant's school records without intimating the defendants or their mother. Ex.P3 is dated 24.7.1997, but PW2 has acted upon the same somewhere during the year 2005. Therefore it appears that on account of his strained relationship with DW1 the plaintiff has engineered changes in the entries made in the school records. 26. Ex.P15, 17 and 18 are issued by the statutory authorities such as Election Commission, City Corporation, Mysore and these documents speak to the effect that the plaintiff and DW1 were residing together as husband and wife; and the 1st defendant was born to them. The plaintiff is bound by his documents and cannot retract from its contents. \n 27. Ex.D1, Certificate dated 30.1.2003 issued by the H.M. of C.K.C. Higher Primary School, Mysore, in respect of 2nd defendant and Ex.D4 issued by the Dy.Director of Public Instructions clearly establish that the plaintiff is the father of the defendants.\n 28. Paternity is a question of fact. The plaintiff is just hanging on to Ex.P3 to prove his case. Having disputed his relationship with the defendants, the plaintiff till date has not come forward to undergo DNA test. Further the circumstances, under which Ex.P3 has come into existence being doubtful, I am of the considered view that no relationship can be placed upon Ex.P3.\n 29. The Trial court by considering all the probabilities and after careful evaluation of the evidence on record has come to the right, just and proper conclusion that the plaintiff is the father of the defendants. Therefore the point for consideration is answered in the affirmative. \n 30. Point No.2: The Learned Counsel for the appellant relies upon the decision in Madhusudan Das Vs Narayani Bai & Ors. reported in AIR 1983 SC 114 wherein it is held that: \"In an appeal against a Trial Court decree, when the appellate court considers an issue turning on oral evidence it must bear in mind that it does not enjoy the advantage which the trial court had in having the witnesses before it and of observing the manner in which they gave their testimony. When there is a conflict of oral evidence on any matter in issue and its resolution turns upon the credibility of the witnesses, the general rule is that the appellate court should permit the findings of fact rendered by the trial court to prevail unless it clearly appears that some special feature about the evidence of a particular witness has escaped the notice of the trial court or there is a sufficient balance of improbability to displace its opinion as to where the credibility lies.\"\n  This decision in my view is more helpful to the respondent rather than the appellant and therefore it is not applicable to the appellant's case. \n 31. The decision in Bishwanath Rai Vs Sachhidanand Singh reported in AIR 1971 SC 1949 and Murarilal Vs State of M.P. reported in AIR 1980 SC 531 are in respect of section 101 and 45, 46, 373, 114 of the Evidence Act. These decisions are also not of any help to the appellant as this court is not after proof of authorship of Ex.P3, but only the circumstances under which it has come to existence and its genuineness. \nSimilarly the decision in Mobarik Ali Ahmed Vs The state of Bombay reported in AIR 1957 SC 857 is also not applicable to the facts of this case. \n 32. For the fore going reasons I am of the considered view that the findings given by the Trial Court in the impugned judgment and decree is well founded and the same does not call for any interference. Accordingly point for consideration is answered in the negative. \n 33. Point No.3: In the result, I pass the following: ORDER The Regular appeal filed under order 41 rule 1 of CPC is hereby rejected with cost of Rs.1000/-. Send back the L.C.R.\n(Dictated to the stenographer, transcribed by her, corrected and then pronounced by me in open court on this, the 3rd day of October 2009).\n (H.R.RADHA), I Addl.

The case of the plaintiff in brief are as follows:- The plaintiff has contended that the defendant is the tenant of the suit schedule property under late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan s/o late Dr. Ahamed Hussain Khan, who had given GPA to his brother Mohammed Jamal Khan to look after the schedule premises. On 1-8-1995, the defendant agreed to pay rent at Rs.2282/- with increase of rent at 15% once in three years and paying rents to the GPA holder Mohammed Jamal Khan, as and when becomes due, the same has been made in writing on 1-9- 1996. After death of Jamal Khan on 8th December 1996, rent was being paid to his son-in-law Dr. Syed Zakiuddin Ali from January 1997 to May 2000 by the defendant and receipts were issued. Thereafter, defendant has stopped paying rents to Dr.\nAhmedulla Khan or Dr. Syed Zakiuddin Ali. Defendant has been informed about the death of Dr. Ahmedulla Khan, who died in May 2005. Legal representatives of said late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan have divided the properties through registered partition deed dt.5-4-2006 and the schedule property has fallen to the share of the plaintiffs. This fact is also made known to thed,, by providing khata of the property in their name in September 2008 and plaintiffs have demanded rents due from the defendant, but the defendant has not chosen to pay the arrears of rent to the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs issued legal notice to the defendant stating that the schedule premises is required for the use of the plaintiffs reasonably and they have terminated the tenancy of the defendant ending on 31st October 2009 and requested the defendant to vacate and hand over the schedule premises and also demanded the arrears of rent. The defendant sent an untenable reply but admitted that he is due rent from June 2000 to the owner of the schedule property, further contended that late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan had no issues. Hence, this suit. 3. After registration of the suit, summons was issued to the defendant. The defendant appeared through his counsel and filed written statement contending that the suit is not maintainable either in law or on facts. He admitted that he is tenant under late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan. He contended that plaintiffs have no right to claim any arrears of rent as they are strangers to the property in question. He admitted that he is tenant under late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan under the registered Lease deed dt.27-9- 1984 and lease period was for 58 months from 1st October 1984 and initially rate of rent is Rs.1,500/- p.m. He admitted that GPA holder of late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan Mohammed Jamal Khan used to collect the rent and defendant enhanced rent to lRs.3,000/- p.m. which was collected till May 2000. Thereafter, said GPA holder did not turn up though defendant intended to pay rent. Said late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan had no heirs-at-law nor legal representatives to succeed to his estate. Without seeking the relief of declaration of title, considering the prayer of the plaintiffs does not arise. Defendant remitted a sum of Rs.42,262/- towards assessment payable. Plaintiffs have no enforceable rights in relation to the suit schedule property. \nDefendant has never recognised the plaintiffs as his landlords. \nHence, prayed for dismissal of the suit. 4. On the basis of the above pleadings, this court has framed the following:- :: I S S U E S :: 1. Whether the plaintiffs prove that they are the absolute owner of the suit schedule? \n 2. Whether the plaintiffs prove that the defendant is a tenant under him ? \n 3. Whether the plaintiffs prove that he has terminated the tenancy by issuing legal notice ? 4. Whether the plaintiffs prove that defendant is liable to pay arrears of rent for a sum of Rs.4,29,900/- ? \n 5. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for the vacant possession of the suit schedule property with damages as prayed in the suit ? \n 6. What Order or Decree? \n 5. The plaintiffs in order to prove their case, got examined plaintiff No.6 and GPA holder of other plaintiffs as PW-1 and got marked the documents Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.22. On the other hand, the defendant himself examined as Dw-1 and got marked the documents Ex.D.1 to Ex.D.21. \n 6. Heard the arguments and perused the material on record. \n 7. My findings on the Issues are as under:- Issue No.1: In the affirmative. \n Issue No.2: In the affirmative. \n Issue No.3: In the affirmative. \n Issue No.4: In the negative. \n Issue No.5: Partly in the affirmative. \n Issue No.6:  As per the final order for the following: - :: R E A S O N S :: 8. ISSUE NOs.1 & 2:-  Since these Issues are interconnected with each other, they are taken up togethr in order to avoid repetition of discussion. \n 9. The above pleadings show that there is an assertion from the side of the plaintiffs that the defendant is the tenant under late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan and after his death, his legal representatives have divided the property through registered Partition deed dt.5-4-2006. This fact was made known to the defendant and the plaintiffs have demanded the rent due to them, but the defendant has not chosen to pay arrears of rent to the plaintiffs. Hence, the plaintiffs are constrained to issue legal notice dt.31-10-2009. The case of the defendant is that there is no relationship of landlord and tenant between himself and the plaintiffs. The original landlord Dr. Ahamedulla Khan died and he had had no Issues. Plaintiffs are not the legal representatives of late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan. The very title of the plaintiffs is disputed. Hence, the suit for eviction is not maintainable without seeking the relief of declaration. \n 10. In this regard, both the parties have let their evidence. \nThat, Pw-1 has reiterated the averments made in the plaint in his examination-in-chief affidavit and marked the original GPA executed by the other plaintiffs in her favour as Ex.P-1 to Ex.P- 5. She also got marked the certified copy of the registered Partition deed dt.5-4-2006 executed between the plaintiffs and other legal representatives of late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan at Ex.P- 6. Other suit schedule property documents are marked at Ex.P- 7 & Ex.P-8, Rent Receipts as per Ex.P-9 & P-10, GPA executed by Dr. Ahamedulla Khan in favour of the Mohammed JamalKhan, who is father of plaintiffs as per Ex.P-11, Lease Agreement as per Ex.P-12 Authorisation letter to the defendant to pay rent issued by her uncle in favour of her father as per Ex.P-13, Title deed dt.31-8-1994 issued by Mysore Urban Development Authority to late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan as Ex.P-14, Ex.P-15 is Genealogical tree, Ex.P-16 is Family survival members certificate, Declarations made by Obedulla Khan,Dr. Rahamth Ulla Khan and Taj Unnissa as Ex.P-17 to Ex.P-19, Death certificates of Mohammed Jamal Khan, Dr. Ahmed Ulla Khan andDr. Zameela Begum Nayira, as Ex.P-20 to Ex.P-22. \n 11. An attempt was made to elicit something in the cross- examination of Pw-1, but she successfully withstood the test of cross-examination. Though Dw-1 has reiterated the written statement averments in his examination-in-chief, but in the cross-examination, the learned Counsel for the plaintiffs has elicited some important admissions and the same will be discussed at a later point of time. \n 12. Dw-1 got marked the cheque book as Ex.D-1, 16 rent paid receipts as Ex.D-2 to Ex.D-17, Notice dt.30-11-2004issued by the Mysore City Corporation as Ex.D-18, Tax paid receipt dt.10- 1-2005 as Ex.D-19, Accounts extract of the defendant as Ex.D- 20, Paper publication dt.11-12-2004 in Vijaya Karnataka daily newspaper as Ex.D-21 and Ex.D-21(a). 13. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs has argued that, the suit schedule property fallen to the share of the plaintiffs through registered Partition deed dt.5-4-2006. After coming to know of this fact also, the defendant did not pay arrears of rent. Hence, the tenancy was duly terminated on 31-10-2009. \n 14. Per contra, the learned Counsel for the defendant has filed written arguments admitting the jural relationship between him and late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan. He further contended that he demise of late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan during May 2005 was informed to the defendant is disputed and registered partition deed is not a sustainable document. There was no heirs to Dr.\nAhamedulla Khan. The allegation of the plaintiffs that the property came to be recorded in the names of the plaintiffs is also disputed by the defendant. Plaintiffs have no right to claim any arrears as they are strangers. As there is no relationship of landlord and tenant between himself and the plaintiffs, the suit of the plaintiffs is not maintainable. Without considering the right of the plaintiffs in the absence of any suit and decree from the competent Court of law, plaintiffs are not entitled to any of the reliefs. From these construction of the parties and documents, the fact remains is that whether the tenant can deny title of the landlord. \n 15.  With these contentions taken up by the parties, I have perused the pleadings, evidence and other materials on record. \n Plaintiffs have contended that the suit schedule property fallen to their share through registered partition deed dt.5-4-2006. It is the case of the plaintiffs that late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan is the landlord and defendant is the tenant under the plaintiff. Dr.\n Ahamedulla Khan had given GPA to his brother Mohammed Jamal Khan in respect of the the suit schedule property and the defendant agreed to pay rent at the rate of Rs.2282/- with an increase of rent at 15% once in three years. Accordingly, defendant was paying rent to the GPA holder Mohammed Jamal Khan. The claim is not disputed by the defendant. After the demise of Mohammed Jamal Khan, the rent was being paid to his son-in-law Syed Zakiuddin Ali from January 1997to June 2000 by the defendant and receipts were issued. Thereafter, defendant stopped paying the rent. Said Dr. Ahamedulla Khan died during May 2005. The legal representatives of the deceased Dr. Ahmedulla Khan have divided the properties of late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan through registered partition deed dt.5- 4-2006 and the suit schedule property has fallen to the share of the plaintiffs who are the sons and daughters of Mohammed Jamal Khan, who was the brother of late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan. \n In this case, the defendant has not disputed the landlord and tenant relationship between himself and the deceased Dr.\nAhmadulla Khan. It is the only defence of the defendant that the plaintiffs are not the legal representatives of the deceased Dr.\nAhmadulla Khan. The defendant himself in his cross- examination has admitted that the deceased Dr. Ahmadulla Khan has no issue. At Ex.P-6 which is the registered Partition deed, the defendants and other legal representatives of Dr. Ahmadulla Khan have stated that the wife of the said Dr. Ahmadulla Khan has taken a voluntary divorce long back. Further, defendants have produced the genealogical tree which is marked at Ex.P-15 shows that plaintiffs are also legal heirs of the deceased Dr.\nAhmadulla Khan. The other legal representatives of Dr.\nAhmadulla Khan have also filed declaration at Ex.P-17 to Ex.P-19 stating that the suit schedule property originally belongs to their brother Dr. Ahmadulla Khan and he died leaving behind him, the defendants and themselves as his legal heirs. Ex.P-6 which is the registered Partition deed clearly shows that the plaintiffs and other legal heirs of the deceased Dr. Ahmadulla Khan have divided the properties of Dr. Ahmadulla Khan and the suit schedule property fallen to the share of the plaintiffs. \n 16. It is further defence of the defendant that he has disputed the title of the plaintiffs over the suit schedule propert, hence, the suit for eviction without seeking the relief of declaration is not maintainable. 17.  Where a tenant with full knowledge of the fats, either expressly or in writing or impliedly by acts, such as the payment of rent, attorns tenant to a person other than his original landlord or one who is claiming the estate of interest of such original landlord by assignment, succession, or othewise, he is ordinarily estopped from questioning the title of the person to whom he has so attorned. Under Section 116 of the Indian Evidence Act, the tenant is estopped from questioning the title of the landlord. Hence, the defendant is precluded from question title of the landlord on the general principles of estoppel between landlord and tenant. Hence, the defence of the defendant is not maintainable. 18. The defendant in his cross-examination has admitted that he stopped paying rent from June 2000. Admittedly, the original landlord Dr. Ahmedulla Khan died in the year 2005. But the defendant has not put forward his steps to deposit the rent before the Court and to pay the rent to Dr. Ahmedulla Khan. \n The very act of the defendant itself shows that he is making false claim. The acts of the plaintiffs by adducing oral and documentary evidence have established their case that, they are the absolute owners of the suit schedule property, by virtue of Partition deed dt.5-4-2006 and defendant is tenant under them. Accordingly, I answer Issue Nos.1 & 2 in the affirmative. \n 19. ISSUE NO.3:- This Issue is framed with respect to termination of tenancy by issuing legal notice. Plaintiffs have asserted that the notice dt.16-10-2009 issued to the defendant terminating the tenancy on 31-10-2009 is valid under law. Of- course, there is no dispute with regard to issuance of such notice in favour of the defendant and the defendant has given reply to the said notice. While answering Issues-1 & 2 have concluded that the plaintiffs are the absolute owners of the suit schedule property and defendant is tenant under them. Said notice was issued on 16-9-2009 which is marked at Ex.P-24 which was served on the defendant on 22-9-2009. The acknowledgement for the same is marked as Ex.P-25 and the defendant has also issued reply dt.15-10-2009 as per Ex.P-26. The plaintiff has called upon the defendant to vacate the deliver vacant possession by the end of tenancy month 31-10-2009. The plaintiff in the notice has clearly stated that the tenancy was terminated by the end of 31-10-2009. Thereafter, plaintiffs have waited for more than 15 days to file this suit. Therefore, the said notice is in consolance with the provisions of S.106 of the Transfer of Property Act. Accordingly, I hold that the notice dt.16-09-2009 is valid under law and I answer Issue No.3 in the affirmative. \n 20. ISSUE NO.4:- This Issue is framed with respect to arrears of rent of Rs.4,29,900/- by the defendant. Though the defendant admitted that he stopped paying rent from June 2000, it is not the case of the plaintiffs that they have issued attornment notice to the defendant after property fallen to their share under the Partition deed dt.5-4-2006. Plaintiffs have further contended that they have informed the defendant during September 2008 that they have acquired the property in their name, but no document is produced by the plaintiffs to show that they have issued attornment notice to the defendant. \nHence, in my opinion, the plaintiffs are not entitled for the arrears of rent till the tenancy is terminated. Therefore, I hold that the defendant is liable to pay arrears of rent only from the date of termination of tenancy. Accordingly, Issue-4 is answered in the negative. \n 21. ISSUE NO.5:- This Issue is framed with respect to entitlement of the plaintiffs for vacant possession of the suit schedule property from the defendant with damages. While answering Issues-1 & 2, I have concluded that plaintiffs are the absolute owners of the suit schedule property and defendant is tenant under them. Hence, the plaintiffs are entitled for vacant possession of the suit schedule property. Plaintiffs have also claimed damages from the date of termination of tenancy as defendant is in unauthorised occupation of the suit schedule property. The remedy of the plaintiffs is to seek damages or mesne profits from the date of termination till possession. At present, there is no evidence to ascertain the damages. Hence, Court shall order to make a separate enquiry to ascertain the damages. Accordingly, Issue-5 is answered partly in the affirmative. \n 22. ISSUE NO.6:- In view of above discussion and conclusion arrive at Issues-1 to 5, I proceed to pass the following:- :: O R D E R :: The suit of the plaintiffs is partly decreed. \n The defendant is hereby directed to vacate and hand over vacant possession of the suit schedule property to the plaintiffs within three months from the date of this judgment. \n The suit of the plaintiffs for recovery of arrears of rent is hereby dismissed. \n There shall be a separate enquiry under Or.20 Rule 12 of C.P.C. to ascertain damages or mesne profits. Parties to bear their own costs.\n                            Draw decree accordingly. \n (Dictated to the Stenographer, transcribed by him, transcript revised, corrected by me and then pronounced in the open Court on this the 18th day of February 2015). \n (Pavithra M.D.), II ADDL.

It was alleged that even though no work\nhad been done and no amount had been disbursed they prepared\ndocuments 'showing the doing of the work and payment of the\namount, They were convicted under s. 218 read with section\n34, section 477A read with section 34 and section 409 read.\nwith section 34 of the Indian Penal Code as well as section\n5(2). read with section 5(1)(d) of the Prevention, of\nCorruption Act. The High Court affirmed the conviction. in\nthe appeal to this Court it was contended that after the\nmatter had been reported to the, higher authorities the\nrectification work was done and the money was disbursed for\nthe purpose for which it had been entrusted; that the\nconviction was bad because of non-compliance with section 5A\nof the Prevention of Corruption Act; and that the\nprosecution was barred by time under s. 23 of the Bombay\nLand Improvement Schemes Act, 1942.\nDismissing the appeal ,\nHELD : (i) There is no cogent ground to disagree with the\ntrial court and the High Court that the accused had prepared \nfalse documents, bad also committed criminal breach of trust\nand were in the discharge, of their duties guilty of\ncriminal misconduct as defined in s. 5 of the Prevention of\n\nCorruption Act. \n(ii)It is no answer to a charge of criminal\nmisappropriation that after the matter bad been reported to\nthe higher authorities the accused got the rectification\nwork done or the money was subsequently disbursed for the\npurpose for which it had been entrusted. According to\nexplanation 1 to section 403 Indian Penal Code a dishonest\nmisappropriation for a time only is \"misappropriation\"\nwithin the meaning of that section. [515 D]\n (iii)It is well established that cognizance of a case,\nhas, in fact, been taken by the court on a police report\nfollowing investigation conducted in breach of provisions of\nsection 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the result\nof the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality in\ntheinvestigation can be shown to have brought about a\nmiscarriage of justice. The reason for the above dictum is\nthat an illegality committed during the course of\ninvestigation does not effect the competence and\njurisdiction of the Court to, try the accused. Where,\ntherefore, the trial of the case has proceeded to\ntermination, the invalidity of the preceding investigation\nwould not vitiate the conviction of the accused as a result\nof the trial unless the illegality in the investigation has\ncaused prejudice to the accused. Since there has been no\nmiscarriage of justice in the present case because of the\nalleged non-compliance with section 5A the conviction of the\nappellants cannot be set aside on that score. [515 H]\nH.N. Rishbud and Inder Singh v. The State of Delhi,\n[1955] 1 S.C.R. 1150, referred to. \n(iv)Sub-section (i) of the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes\nAct 1942 has plainly no application as it relates to anyth\ning done in the good faith. It cannot also be said\nthat the acts of the appellants in preparing false documents\nand committing criminal breach of trust as also the act of\ncriminal misconduct were done \"under\" the Bombay Land\nImprovement Schemes' Act within the meaning of sub-section\n(2). The subsection has no application where something is\ndone not under the Act even though it has been done by a\npublic servant who has been entrusted with the duties of\ncarrying improvement schemes under this Act. The impugned\nacts of the appellants was not in discharge of their duties\nunder the Act but in obvious breach and flagrant disregard\nof their duties.

This is an appeal by special leave by Khandu Sonu Dhobi and Bhikanrao Rambhau Khairnar against the judgment of the Bombay High Court affirming on appeal the conviction of the appellants under section 218 read with section 34, section 477A read with section 34 and section 409 read with section 34 of Indian Penal Code as well as under section 5 (2) read with section 5 ( 1 ) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year and a fine of Rs. 200 or in default further rigorous imprisonment for a period of two months has been awarded on each count to, the appellants.. The substantive sentences have ben ordered to run concurrently. \nDhobi appellant No. 1 was an agricultural assistant and was working under Khairnar appellant No. 2 who was agriculturalsupervisor in the soil conservation section of the Government of Maharashtra. Dhobi was incharge of the work relating to a Bundh in block No. 13 of village Asane in Taluka Mandurbar. The above block comprises agricultural lands bearing survey Nos. 8, 17, 18, 19 and 32 measuring 90 acres. The Bundhs were being constructed since the year 1962. Rectification work in respect of those Bundhs at a cost of Rs. 369.07 had to be got done by Dhobi appellant under the supervision of Khaimar appellant. The Government sanctioned an amount of Rs. 4779 in connection with the construction of the Bundhs. An advance amount of Rs. 5000 was received by Khaimar accused on March 2, 1966 in that connection. Work of the value, of Rs. 4400 was done but that relating to rectification work was not done. According to the rules of the soil conservation section, the Government spent the money in the first instance and after the report of the completion of work was received, the expenses were recovered from the landowners for whose benefit the work was done. On March 11, 1966 Khaimar made entries in measurement book Ex. 27 showing that he had checked 28 payments and certified the, same. Khaimar accused also stated in the entry that he had passed the measurements and paid Rs. 369.07. Paysheets Ex. 64 were prepared by Dhobi accused and he obtained the thumb impressions and signatures of the laborers on the paysheets. \nKhaimar made his initials below the thumb impressions in the paysheets. On the last page of the paysheets, Khaimar signed a certificate according to which he had paid Rs.\n369.07 to PW 10 Jagan Trinibak who used to do the labour work. Final bill Ex. 28 was also prepared on that day by the accused and the signature of Jagan Trimbak was obtained on the same. The bill was got signed from PW 7 Ziparu Tukaram and another person as attesting witnesses. The bill was signed thereafter by Khaimar. Debit entry Ex. 32 of Rs. \n369.07 was made by Khaimar accused in the cash book. He also prepared work abstract Ex. 29 on April 16, 1966 and sent it to the sub-divisional soil conservation officer Nandurbar showing an expenditure of Rs. 369-07. \nThe case of the prosecution was that the measurement book Ex. 27, paysheets Ex. 64, final bill Ex. 28 and cash book entry Ex. 32 were false documents and were fabricated by the accused without doing any reification work on the Bundh. \nThe accused thus committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the amount of Rs. 369.07 in furtherance of their common intention to misappropriate government property. According further to the prosecution case, the landowners in block No. 13 came to know of the, above, acts of the accused and they complained about it to Sarpanch Tanku Bhagwan (PW 12). Tanku sent a telegram on April 12, 1966 to the superintending agricultural officer, Bombay division, Nasik in this connection. A copy of the telegram wasthereafter sent by the superintending agricultural officer to divisional soil conservation officer D.S.D. Ghate (PW 1) for necessary action as well as for enquiry and report. Chate PW went to village Asane on May 2, 1966 and inspected block No. 13. He found that entries had been made about the payment of Rs. 369.07 in the measurement book and cash book even though no rectification work had been done. Chate submitted his report on May 6, 1966 for proceeding departmentally against the accused. On receipt of the above report, the superintending agricultural officer directed P.\nR. Inamdar (PW 1 1 ), deputy director of agricultural engineering, to go to Asane village and submit his report after personally verifying the facts. Inamdar went with Ghate to block No. 13 in Asane village on May 11, 1966. Both Inamdar and Ghate found that no rectification work had been done. They did not find even a single pit in the lands in that block although, according to measurement book, 83 pits had been recently dug. Inamdar and Ghate also met the Sarpanch and other landowners of Asane village. Report dated May 18, 1966 was thereafter submitted by Inamdar affirming those facts. \nSarpanch Tanku sent complaint Ex. 84, in the meanwhile, on April 30, 1966 to the director of anti-corruption branch Maharashtra State stating that the accused had prepared false bill for Rs. 369.07 without doing any work and that they had misappropriated that amount. It was also stated that attempts were being made to shield the accused. The director of anti-corruption sent a copy of that application to Sub Inspector K. G. Patil (PW 13) who was then attached to Dhulia officse of the anticorruption branch. Sub Inspector Patil made local enquiry and took into possession the measurement book, paysheets and cash book. The director of anti-corruption branch directed Patil to register a case and investigate into the, matter. Patil went to Nasik and recorded statement Ex. 79 of Inamdar PW on November 7, 1966. \nThe statement was then sent to Nandurbar Taluka police station. A case was registered on the basis of that statement at the police station on November 8, 1966. On November 12, 1966 sub Inspector Patil applied for permission under section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act of judicial magistrate 1st class to investigate the offence. \nThe permission was granted by the judicial magistrate 1st class Nandurbar on the same day. Patil thereafter recorded statements of a number of persons. Patil was subsequently transferred and the case was investigated by his successors Mahamuni and Kulkarni who also obtained the requisite permission. Sanction Ex. 97 for the prosecution of the two accused was granted under section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act by the superintending agricultural officer Bombay division, Nasik on May 18, 1967.The two accused in their statements admitted that the work of the value of Rs. 369.07 wasnot done till March 11, 1966 although it was so stated in the various documents by them. The accused also admitted that no amounts were paid to any of the labourers mentioned in the paysheets although signatures and thumb impressions of the labourers had been obtained on the paysheets on March 11, 1966. According to the accused, they had prepared the various documents in accordance with the instructions of Ghate PW who was insisting in March 1966, and even earlier, that a completion report relating to block No. 13 be sent as the entire amount spent on that block since 1962 could not be recovered for want of a. completion report . Khaimar accused added that rectification work had been done between May 13, 1966 and May 16, 1966 and the amount of Rs. 369.07 was thereafter disbursed on May 16, 1966. The learned special judge held that the amount of Rs. 369.07 had not been paid by the two accused to the labourers. No work, it was found, had been done and the different documents prepared by the accused in this connection were false even on their own admissions. The explanation furnished by the accused that they prepared false documents at the instance of Ghate and got work done thereafter was not accepted. Objection was raised on behalf of the accused that the investigation of the case was illegal and that prosecution was barred by time under the pro-visions of section 23 of the Land Improvement Schemes Act, 1942. These objections were repelled. The accused were accordingly convicted and sentenced as above. \nOn appeal the High Court affirmed the, findings of the learned special judge. \nWe have heard Mr. Kotwal on behalf of the, appellants and are of the opinion that there is no merit in the appeal. It has not been disrupted before us that the accused made various entries and prepared documents on March 11, 1966 about their having got the rectification work done as well as about the payment of Rs. 369.07 on that account. It has also not been disputed before us that the amount of Rs. 369- 07 was not paid to any one by the accused in March or April 1966. According to Ghate (PW 1) and Inamdar (PW 11), no work relating to the rectification of the Bundh was found to have been done till May 11, 1966 when they visited the site in question. Inamdar's evidence also shows that according to the measurement book prepared by the accused, 83 pits had been recently dug although the witness could not find a single pit on the spot. In view of the above, we find no cogent ground to disagree with the trial court and the High Court that the accused had prepared false documents and had also committed criminal breach of trust in respectof the amount of Rs. 369.07. We also agree with the trial court and the High Court that the accused were in the discharge of their duties guilty of criminal misconduct as defined in section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. \nMr. Kotwal has argued that the accused completed the recti- fication work after May 11, 1966,. There is, however, no direct evidence as may show that the, rectification work was completed' after May 11, 1966. Even if it may be assumed that the accused completed the rectification work in May 1966, that fact, in our opinion, would not absolve the accused of their criminal liability. The charge, against the accused relates to preparation of false documents because even though no work had been done till March 11, 1966 and no amount had been disbursed, they prepared docu- ments showing the doing of that work and the payment of that amount. It is no answer to, that charge that after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities, the accused in the month of May 1966 got the rectification work done. It is also no answer to a charge of criminal misappropriation that the money was subsequently, after the matter had been reported to the high authorities, disbursed for the purpose for which it had been entrusted. According to explanation 1 to section 403 Indian Penal Code, a dishonest misappropriation for a time only is \"\nmisappropriation \" within the meaning of that section. \nMr. Kotwal has also submitted that the accused expressed willingness to complete the work after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities. This submission, 'even if accepted, would not exonerate the accused because the willingness after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities could not efface or undo the offence earlier committed by the accused. \nArgument has then been advanced on behalf of the appellants that Sub Inspector Patil did not make investigation in the case in accordance with law. It is urged that permission to make investigation was granted to Sub Inspector Patil on November 12, 1966 and, as such, he was not authorized to make before that date the enquiry which led to the registration of the case as that enquiry partook of the character of investigation. Nothing has been brought to our notice as to how an enquiry before the registration of a case can be held to be investigation. The matter, however, need not be dilated upon and it is not necessary to express any final opinion in the matter because we find that there is no material on the record as may show that the accused were prejudiced because of the alleged non-compliance with the provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act. It is well established that where cxognizance of a case has, in fact, been taken by the court on a police report following investigationconducted in breach of provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the result of the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about a miscarriage of justice. The underlying reason for the above dictum is that an illegality committed in the course of investigation does not affect the competence and jurisdiction of the court to try the accused. Where, therefore, the trial of the case has proceeded to termination, the invalidity of the proceeding investigation would not vitiate the conviction of the accused as a result of the trial unless the illegality in the investigation has caused prejudice to the accused (see H. N. Rishbud and Inder Singh v. The State of DelHi(1)]. Since there has been no miscarriage of justice in the present case because of the alleged non-compliance with section 5A, the conviction of the accused appellants cannot be set aside on that score. \nFor the same reason, we are unable to accede to the contention of Mr. Kotwal that the conviction of the accused should be set aside because permission under section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act to SI Patil for investigation of the offence was granted in a ,casual manner and without the existence of sufficient reasons. \n Lastly, it has been argued by Mr. Kotwal that the prosecution of the accused was barred by time under section 23 of the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes, Act, 1942. The section reads as under \"(1) No suit, prosecution or other legal proceeding shall be instituted against any public servant or person duly authorized under this Act in respect of anything in good faith done or intended to be done under this Act or the rules made thereunder.\n                         (2)No suit or prosecution shall be instituted against any public servant or person duly authorized under this Act in respect of anything done or intended to be done, under this Act, unless the, suit or prosecution has been instituted within six months from the date of the act complained of.\"\nSub-section (1) of the section has plainly no application as it relates to anything done in good faith. According to Bombay General Clauses Act, a thing shall be deemed to be done in good faith where it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not. The appellants admittedly were not acting honestly when they prepared the false documents in question and showed disbursement of Rs.\n369.07 on March 11, 1966. Mr. Kotwal, however, relies on sub-section (2) of section 23 and (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1150.\n submits that the prosecution could be instituted against the appellants only within six months from March 11, 1966. As the charge sheet was submitted long after the expire of six months, the case against the accused-appellants, according to the counsel, was barred by time. This contention, in our opinion, is devoid of force. Sub-section (2) refers to suit or prosecution against a public servant or person duly authorized under the Act in respect of anything done or intended to be done under the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes Act. It cannot be said that the acts of the accused-appellants in preparing false documents and in committing criminal breach of trust in respect of the amount of Rs. 369-07 as also their act of criminal misconduct were done under the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes Act. Sub- section (2) of section 23 deals with anything done or intended to be done under the above mentioned Act by a public servant or a person duly authorized under the Act. \n It has no application where something is done not under the Act even though it has been done by a public servant who has been entrusted with duties of carrying out improvement schemes under the above mentioned Act. The impugned acts of the appellants in the present case were not in discharge of their duties under the above mentioned Act but in obvious breach and flagrant disregard of their duties. Not only they did no rectification work for the Bundh which was a part of the improvement scheme, they also misappropriated the amount which had been entrusted to them for the purpose of rectification. \n Prayer has also been made for the reduction of the sentence, but we see no cogent ground to interfere with the same. The appeal consequently fails and is dismissed. \n K.B.N.                     Appeal dismissed.\n 5--L1031 Sup.CI/72",

This appeal is filed by Accused Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 9 against the judgment of the High Court whereby Guru @ Gurubaran (A1) and Durai @ Durairajan (A2) have been convicted under Section 302, Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sentenced to imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/ each with default sentence of 3 months rigorous imprisonment (RI). As far as Vettri @ Vetrivell (A3) is concerned , he was convicted under Section 324 IPC on two counts and sentenced to one year RI on each count and fine of Rs.1000/ with default sentence of 3 months. Narayanan (A5) and Srinivasan (A9) along with other accused were convicted under Section 323 IPC and sentenced to undergo six months RI and pay fine of Rs.1000/ each with default sentence of 3 months. All the sentences were to run concurrently. \n 2. The prosecution case is that Parasuraman (PW14), son of deceased Saroja and Munusamy Pillai (PW1), was in love with Uma, the younger sister of A1. They both got married and after the marriage, PW14 lived in his wife's house. However, Saroja (deceased) did not approve of this. Thereafter, PW14 came back to his house. On 03.03.1998, it is alleged that Jayaraman (A4) assaulted Nagarajan (PW2), brother of Saroja and brotherinlaw of PW1. To settle the dispute, a Panchayat was called the next day. It is admitted that this Panchayat was called at the instance of A1. The Panchayat was to be conducted in the evening. \nHowever, since the Pradhan of the Panchayat was indisposed, the Panchayat could not be held. Thereafter, PW2, his sister Saroja (deceased), his wife Rani (PW7), Murugan (PW13) and Naveen Kumar, son of PW2 and PW7 stood outside the house of PW2 talking amongst themselves. According to him, PW13 had come to the village because of the Panchayat. While they were standing there, A1 came armed with a sickle (Koduval), A2 armed with an Iron Pipe, A3 armed with a sickle (Koduval) and A4 to A9 carrying thick wooden staffs in their hands. It is alleged that A1 attacked deceased Saroja with a sickle on the front portion of her head and said that it was only because of her that the younger sister of A1 has to live separately from her husband. A2 gave a blow on the back of the neck of Saroja with an iron pipe. The other accused are alleged to have attacked Saroja with wooden staffs in their hand. When the family members of Saroja tried to protect her, all the 9 accused surrounded her and, as such, they could not protect her. According to the eyewitnesses, they were also attacked by the members of the aggressive party. The version of all the eye witnesses is similar. \n 3. However, there are some discrepancies with regard to the manner in which the said incident took place. According to PW 1, on the date of Panchayat, first a verbal altercation took place between the two sides and then the attack took place whereas, according to PW2 and some of the other eyewitnesses, the attack took place without any provocation. We are of the considered view that for the purpose of deciding this appeal, we can even presume that there was some verbal altercation between the two sides. \n 4. The occurrence is not denied. The main defence is that there was a free fight on both sides and that there is no evidence to show that there is prior meeting of minds. The accused had not been convicted under Section 34 or Section 149 IPC and, therefore, each individual accused can only be convicted for the injury attributed to that individual. Therefore, it becomes relevant to refer to the medical evidence of the autopsy surgeon Dr. Rajamani, Assistant Surgeon (PW3). The injuries are as follows: \"1. An Antemortem red, oblique lacerated wound measuring 6cm x 1cm x 1cm, exposing the bones over the left frontal region of scalp, 1 cm away from the midline with bleeding and blood clots. On Exploring the wound, echymosis seen behind the scalp over the frontal, parietal, temporal and back of skull. There is a fracture of frontal bone measuring 5 cm in length, vertical, para sagittally and 1cm away from midline over the left side, extended to upwards to fronto parietal junction, and another fracture line which is adjacent to it and slightly oblique from the frontal bone to towards fronto parietal junction, 4cm x 1/8 on and on exposing the skull bones blood clots seen over the membranes of the leftcerebral hemisphere of brain on the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital region, of the brain. Both fractures are involving inner and outer table of the skull. \n 2.  An abrasions varying size from 3cm to 21/2cm x  cm with  cm different from each other, oblique, placed over middle 1/3 of right side neck. \n 3.  An AM abrasion 21/2cm x  cm obliquely placed 1cm away from injury No.2 on right side of neck. \n 4.  An AM swelling whole of the anterior and lateral side of right side neck. On exposing the injury No.2, 3, 4 minor blood clots under the skin of neck and congestion of sternomastoid muscle and blood clots seen in anterior and lateral side of right side neck.\" \n 5. The doctor states that these injuries caused the death. The first injury is a lacerated wound and it is urged by Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned senior counsel, that this injury could not have been caused by sickle (Koduval), which is a sharpedged weapon. A sickle is an instrument mainly meant for cutting grass and crops. The inner side is sharp but the outer side is blunt. While using it as an instrument of agriculture only, the sharp edge is used but while using it as a weapon of offence, more often than not, it will be the outer side which will be used to hit the victim. The doctor has opined that the injury could have been caused by a sickle which is MO1 and, therefore, the medical evidence fully corroborates the version of all the eye witnesses. \n 6. It was next urged that the offence was not of murder but may amount to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. It has been urged that the case would fall within Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC, which reads as follows: \"Exception 4  Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.\"\n 7. We are of the view that the accused cannot take benefit of this Exception. It has come in evidence that all the accused persons came armed. Two were armed with sickles, one with an iron pipe and the other with wooden staffs. Even if it is assumed that they may not have come with the intention of killing, the fact that they were armed, clearly indicates that the occurrence did not take place in the heat of passion, upon a sudden quarrel. As pointed out above, both sides were coming to attend a Panchayat to settle a dispute. Where was the need to carry arms if the intention was only to settle a dispute? Even otherwise, we feel that Exception 4 is not applicable because the manner in which the blow was given right on the middle of the head, brings this case squarely within clause \"Fourthly\" of Section 300 IPC, which reads as follows: \"300. Murder   xxx  xxx  xxx Secondly        xxx  xxx  xxx Thirdly         xxx  xxx  xxx Fourthly  If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.\" \n 8. A1 should have known that the act which he is performing, of hitting the deceased on the head with a sickle with such great force causing fracture of the skull, is so dangerous that it would have imminently caused death. Therefore, we find no reason to alter the sentence or conviction of Guru @ Gurubaran (A1). \n 9. However, as far as Durai @ Durairajan (A2) is concerned, since the High Court has held that neither Section 34 nor Section 149 IPC are applicable, each accused will only be responsible for his own acts and injuries. In this behalf, reference was made to a judgment of this Court in the case of Atmaram Zingaraji vs.\nState of Maharashtra1. There is no appeal by the State. As far as A2 is concerned, he is alleged to have given a blow with an iron pipe on the back of the neck of the deceased. This resulted in injury numbers 2 and 3. They are merely abrasions and could not have caused death. Therefore, the accused can only be held guilty of having committed the offence under Section 324 IPC. \nHe has already undergone imprisonment for around 11 years and, therefore, his conviction under Section 302 IPC is altered to Section 324 IPC and the sentence is reduced to the period of incarceration already undergone. As far as Vettri @ Vetrivell (A 3), Narayanan (A5) and Srinivasan (A9) are concerned, we find no reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court as each has been held guilty for the offence which they have committed. \n 10. In view of the above, the appeal of Accused Nos. 1, 3, 5 and 9 is dismissed and the appeal of Accused No. 2 is allowed and his 1 (1997) 7 SCC 41 conviction is altered from offence punishable under Section 302 IPC to offence punishable under Section 324 IPC and the sentence is reduced to the period of incarceration already undergone. \n 11. AccusedAppellant Nos.1 & 2 were granted bail vide this Court's order dated 08.01.2018. In view of the above, bail bond of Appellant No.1 (A1) is cancelled. He shall be taken into custody forthwith to serve remaining period of the sentence and bail bond of Appellant No.2 (A2) is discharged. Pending application(s), if any, stand(s) disposed of. ..............................J.\n                                (Deepak Gupta) ..............................J.\n                             (Aniruddha Bose) New Delhi September 27, 2019",

Tawakley, (K. P. Gupta, with him), for the appellant. \nK.B. Asthana and C. P. Lal, for the respondent. \n 1955. September 28. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J. -The only. question here is about sen.\n tence.\n  The appellant Bed Raj and another, Sri Chand, were jointly charged with the murder of one Pheru. The Sessions Judge convicted Bed Raj under section 304, Indian Penal Code, and sentenced him to three years' rigorous imprisonment. He acquitted Sri Chand. I Bed Raj appealed to the High, Court and that Court, on admitting the appeal for hearing, issued notice to the appellant to show cause why the sentence should not be enhanced. The appeal and the revision were heard together. \n The appeal was dismissed and the High Court enhanced the sentence to ten years. \n Now, though no limitation has been placed on the High Court's power to enhance it is nevertheless a judicial act and, like all judicial acts involving an exercise of discretion, must be exercised along, well known judicial lines. The only question before us is whether those lines have been observed in the present case. \n The facts that have been found by the Sessions Judge and accepted by the High Court are to be found in the opening paragraph of the learned Sessions Judge's judgment. They are as follows: \"Roop Chand, the son of Bed Raj accused, was removing the dung. of the bullocks of Pheru deceased from an open space near his cattle shed. Pheru protested to, the boy and turned down the basket in which the boy had put the dung. The two accused who are brothers then came to the scene from their own cattle shed which was near by and there was an exchange of abuses between them and Pheru. The accused Sri Chand then caught hold of Pheru by the waist and Bed Raj accused took out a knife and stabbed him in 3 or 4 places. \n The knife was then left sticking in the neck of the deceased and the accused ran away\". \n The assault occurred about 8 o'clock on the morning of the 23rd February 1952. Pheru was removed to the hospital and the Medical Officer Dr. Fateh Singh examined him and found that he was suffering from shock. He found three injuries on his person: all \"simple\". He gave the following description of them: right side lower part. \n (2) Incised wound: 1 \" x 1/3\" X1/3\" right deltoid region frontal and lower part above downward. \n (3) Incised wound 1/2\" X 1/6\" X 1/4\"Epigastric region\".\n  He said- \"When Pheru was admitted in the hospital he was under shock but his condition was not dangerous . When Pheru came he could speak. He was not unconscious. As he was under shock no report was made for recording his dying declaration. I cannot give the definite cause of death. I cannot tell if sucH an InjurY can cause death. There was no Haemorrhage from Pheru's neck after his arrival in my hospital. Speaking:of the inJurieis, the doctor said- \"Injuries 2 and 3 on the person of Pheru which were incised wounds were not punctured. It was not possible to inflict them from a sharp pointed weapon\". \n The appellant was also examined by the doctor and a slight simple injury, which could have; been caused by a simple blunt weapon, was discovered. This indicates that there was a scuffle between the appellant and the deceased, in which the appellant was hit over the nose and, up to a point, bears out what the appellant says in his defence, namely that Pheru was beating the appellant's son Rup Chand; he went there and tried to extricate Rup Chand; Pheru started beating him (the appellant) and he, the appellant, received a flat blow on the nose.\n  The depth of the injury on Pheru's neck was I of an inch. \nIn this connection the doctor says- \"A knife can penetrate 1 1/2 or 2 inches in a case of deliberate stabbing\". \n Pheru died about 12-45 A.M. on the 24th February 1952, that is to say, about 16 or 17 hours after the assault. The post-mortem was conducted by another doctor, Dr. J. K.\nDwivedi. Describing the injury on the neck-the only one we need consider as the other two were slight-he said that clotted blood was present all round injury No, 1, and, that--\"the:right side dome of pleura is punctured under injury No.\n1 and clotted blood present all round it. Upper lobe of right lung (appex) is punctured for 1/4\" X 1/4\" X 1/2\". \nClotted blood present over the lung surface all round the punctured area. A branch of the external jugular vein was divided in right side neck under injury No. I. Death was due to shock, and haemorrhage as a result of injury to neck\". In cross-examination he said- \"It was possible and impossible also that the bleeding could be stopped. Such injury as injury No. I are more likely to cause death\". After reviewing the evidence 'the learned Sessions Judge held- \"It is evident that the whole scene took just a few moments. Both of the accused must have been in a moment of heat and before either of them could think of doing any act, the whole thing was over........ That the injuries with the knife were likely to cause death is clear but they were caused at a time when the parties were in a heat and there was a sudden fight and no room for premeditation\".\n  Because of this, and seeing that there was no reason to infer pre-concert, he acquitted the other accused, and by reason of those circumstances he considered that three years would be sufficient punishment and sentenced the appellant accordingly. This was on 17-11-1952. \nThe appellant filed an appeal to the High Court on 1.8-12- 1952 and that Court thereupon issued notice to him to show cause why the sentence I should not be enhanced. The High Court directed enhancement on 7-1-1954. \n On the same day the State Government ordered the release of the appellant on probation, under section 2 of the U.P.\nPrisoners' Release on Probation Act, 1938, for the full term of the sentence imposed by the Sessions Court. We are not concerned with the State Government's order except in so far' as it indicates the view that that Government took of the antecedents and conduct in prison of the appellant, matters that are also relevant for consideration by a Courtwhen determining a, question of sentence-' a prisoner can only be released on probation under that Act if the State Government is satisfied \"from his antecedents and his conduct in the prison that he is likely to abstain from crime and lead a peaceable life, if he is released from prison\".\n  These facts were not known to the High Court when it made its order of enhancement' but it is a matter relevant for our consideration now that the appeal is before us. \n Now the High Court accept the findings of the Sessions Judge about the circumstances in which the offence took place. \nThey agree that the attack was not premeditated and that there was a sudden quarrel and that the blows were inflicted in the heat of passion,. They also say that there was counter-abuse and they notice the abrasion on the appellant's nose. Despite this they hold-that' \"it is possible that this injury was received by the appellant in the attempt of the deceased to resist the attack made by the appellant. There was therefore no fight'. \n This is a very half-hearted finding and ignores the fact that the benefit of all doubts must be given to the accused. \nIf it was only \"possible\" that the injury was due to Pheru's attempt to ward off an attack by the appellant, then it must be equally \"possible\" that it was received in the course of a, scuffle. The appellant very definitely says in his examination that there was a fight and the abrasion on his nose which the doctor says was caused by a blunt weapon, bears out his version that Pheru struck him with his fist. \nThe circumstances also indicate that there must have been a scuffle. Why else should it be necessary for the second accused to come and hold him down by the waist? When villagers or any man for that matter, come to blows after hot words and an interchange of abuse, there is nearly always resistance to the initial attack. Very rarely does a man \"turn the other cheek\". It must also be remembered that the incident started with the use of force by Pheru. It was he who took hold of the basket of cow dung andoverturned it. That occasioned the quarrel, and the finding is that there was abuse and counter-abuse. It was then that the second accused rushed in and caught Pheru by the waist. \nThat accused was acquitted because there was nothing to suggest that that was done in aid of the appellant's intention to-assault Pheru and he -was absolved of all intention to assault on his own account; and the finding is that even the appellant had no such intention till the last moment. If that was the case, then why should the second accused rush in and hold Pheru by the waist? If he had no intention to assault on his own account and none to assist the appellant in his assault, the only other reasonable conclusion is that he tried to stop a fight. It would be fair in the circumstances to reach that conclusion, for the accused is as much entitled to the benefit of any doubt when a co-accused is acquitted as in any other case. In any case, it was incumbent on the High Court to reach a more definite finding than the one given before -deciding to enhance the sentence. \n The only reason that the learned Judges give is that Pheru was unarmed and as the attack was made with a knife it cannot be said that the appellant did not act in a cruel or unusual manner. Nevertheless, they uphold the finding that the offence falls under section 304, Indian Penal Code, and not under section 302. \n A question of a sentence is a matter of discretion and it is well settled that when discretion has been properly exercised along accepted judicial lines, an appellate court should not interfere to the detriment of an accused person except for very strong reasons which must be disclosed on the face of the judgment; see for example the observations in Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab(1) and Nar Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2). In a matter of enhancement there should not be interference when the sentence passed imposes substantial punishment. Interference is only called for when it is manifestly inadequate. In our opinion, these principles have not been observed. It is (1) [1954] S.C.R. 145, 156.\n(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 238, 241,impossible to hold in'the circumstances described that the Sessions Judge did not impose a substantial, sentence, and no adequate reason has been assigned by the learned High Court Judges for considering the sentence, manifestly inadequate. In the circumstances, bearing all the considerations of this case in mind, we are of opinion that the appeal (which is limited to the question of sentence) should be allowed and that the sentence imposed by the High Court should be set aside and that of the Sessions Court restored. Ordered accordingly.",

NO.2306 OF 2011) \n\nJ U D G M E N T \n Deepak Gupta, J. 1. Leave granted in appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.2306 of 2011. \n 2. Both the appeals are being disposed of by a common judgment. \n 3. The undisputed facts are that the deceased Arun was a friend of accused Siva @ Sivaprakash, Accused No.1. The deceased along with Accused No. 1 and Chandru @ Chandrasekaran, Accused No. 2, travelled to Chennai on 30.10.2004. They went to Meena Guest House, run by M. Sheik Davood (PW3) at about 9 p.m. where room no. 203 was allotted to them. At about 9.30 p.m. Venkatesh @ Venki came to the room. Venki injected 4 ml of Tidijesic drug into the left wrist of deceased Arun. Venki also used 2 ml drug for himself. \nThereafter, Venki left the guest house. Next morning i.e. on 31.10.2004, the two appellants herein called Venki since Arun did not get up. The room boy of the lodge viz., Sankar (PW4) complained to the Manager of the lodge that a lot of people were coming into room no. 203. It was found that Arun was dead. \nThereafter, Iqbal (PW2), working as Manager in the company owned by father of the deceased Arun and Ponsekar (PW1), maternal uncle of the deceased came to the room. 4. PW1 filed a complaint on 31.10.2004 at 9.45 a.m., in which he stated that his nephew Arun was earlier studying in an engineering college at Chennai. However, he was not studying properly and had developed some bad habits and, therefore, he was shifted to a college at Thoothukudi. The relevant portion of the complaint is to the effect that on 31.10.2004 at about 7.30 a.m. he had received a call from Iqbal (PW2) informing him that his nephew Arun, who stayed the night in Room No.203 of Meena Guest House had consumed heavy dose of a drug through injection and is unconscious. He immediately went to the guest house where he found that his nephew was dead. He thereafter went to Triplicane Police Station and lodged the report. \n 5. On the basis of the aforesaid report a case being Crime No.1150 of 2004, was registered. The body of the deceased was sent for postmortem. Dr. A.N. Shanmugham (PW6) conducted the postmortem. He stated that he could not say with certainty what was the cause of death but it was possible by drug injection. Venki was arrested in connection with the said crime and he allegedly made a confessional statement to the police on 08.11.2004 which led to the discovery of Tidijesic syringe, empty ampoules, unused Tidijesic ampoule etc.. PW1, the maternal uncle of the deceased, filed a petition in the High Court of Madras in February, 2005 seeking transfer of the investigation to some other agency since he was not happy with the manner in which the case was being investigated. The High Court vide order dated 28.02.2005 transferred the investigation to the CB CID, Tamil Nadu. There were three suspects before the police viz., Venkatesh @ Venki, Sivaprakash @ Siva and Chandrasekaran @ Chandru. \nAll three were subjected to Polygraph, Brainmapping and Narcoanalysis tests at a Forensic Science Laboratory. According to the Investigating Officer (DW4), who carried the investigation, the two appellants herein cleared the said tests and there was no suspicion against them since they disclosed no signs of deception. However, during the tests, Venki's answers were found deceptive. \n 6. In the year 2006, PW5, father of the deceased, filed a petition in the Madras High Court for transferring the investigation of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). This petition was rejected by the High Court on 08.02.2008. Meanwhile, on 23.01.2008, more than three years after the incident, a chargesheet was filed by the CB CID under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short `CrPC') only against Venkatesh @ Venki under Section 304 Part II of the Indian Penal Code (for short `IPC'). The present accused (appellants herein) were cited as prosecution witnesses in the said chargesheet. Venki died after the filing of the chargesheet but before trial of the case on 21.07.2008.\n 7. It was only thereafter that PW1, maternal uncle of the deceased, filed a private complaint before the court which is Exhibit P1. In this complaint it was stated that the two accused and the deceased had stayed in Room No. 203 and Venki came to the room at the invitation of the accused Chandru. Venki was a drug peddler and Arun was not in the habit of taking drugs. On the request of the accused, Venki had injected 4 ml of Tidijesic injection in the left wrist of the deceased. It was also alleged that Venki was paid Rs.50/ by the accused Siva for his services. \nAccording to this complaint, Arun had been injected for the second time in the left arm inner portion. When this witness went to the room No. 203, Venki was present and told the complainant that the accused had given excess narcotic drugs on the left inner portion of the arm due to which the deceased died. \nIn the complaint it was also stated that immediately after he had visited the guest house on 31.10.2004, he had gone to the Triplicane Police Station, where the police forcibly obtained his signatures on two blank papers. It was alleged that the FIR was lodged by the police in connivance with the two accused. In this complaint it is also mentioned that there were marks of injecting two injections and, according to the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory, a huge amount of narcotic substance had been injected into the deceased which caused his death. In this complaint it was also alleged that the accused Siva had close association with PW10 (hereinafter referred to as `R'). According to the complainant, R (PW10) was introduced to the deceased Arun and they used to regularly talk to each other on phone every day and therefore, accused Siva could not tolerate that his girlfriend should shift loyalty to some other person. Therefore, he approached Chandru, who was a student in a medical college and with his help injected excess dose of Tidijesic with the intention of killing Arun. 8. After the filing of the private complaint, the metropolitan magistrate recorded the statements of seven witnesses and found sufficient grounds for proceeding with the case under Section 302 IPC. Thereafter, the case was committed to the Court of Sessions and charges were framed against the accused, who pleaded not guilty. The evidence of the witnesses were recorded. \nAccused also examined four witnesses. The trial court convicted the accused for having committed the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC read with Section 120B IPC and sentenced them to undergo life imprisonment. Aggrieved, the accused filed two separate criminal appeals, which have been dismissed. Hence, the present appeals. \n 9. Admittedly, there are no eyewitnesses to the case and this is a case based on circumstantial evidence. The law with regard to appreciation of circumstantial evidence has been clearly enunciated in the case of Hanumant v. State of Madhya Pradesh1, wherein this Court held as follows: \"10......It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.\" \n 10. This law has been consistently followed and has been repeated in catena of authorities. It is not necessary to refer to all the authorities. However, we may refer to Sir Alfred Wills book Wills on Circumstantial Evidence (Chapter VI)2, in which he has laid down the following Rules specially to be observed in the case of circumstantial evidence: \"RULE 1.  The facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved, and beyond reasonable doubt connected with the factum probandum............\n 1 AIR 1952 SC 343 2 Butterworths, Seventh Edition, Pp 296-329.\n RULE 2.  The burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact which infers legal accountability................\n                  RULE 3.  In all cases, whether of direct or circumstantial evidence, the best evidence must be adduced which the nature of the case admits.........\n                  RULE 4.   In order to justify the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused, and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt.................. \n                  RULE 5.  If there by any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, he is entitled as of right to be acquitted.\" \n 11. The law can be summarised in the following terms: 1. The circumstances relied upon by the prosecution which lead to an inference to the guilt of the accused must be proved beyond doubt; 2. The circumstances should unerringly point towards the guilt of the accused; 3. The circumstances should be linked together in such a manner that the cumulative effect of the chain formed by joining the links is so complete that it leads to only one conclusion i.e. the guilt of the accused; 4. That there should be no probability of the crime having been committed by a person other than the accused. 12. It is in the light of the aforesaid law that we have to consider the evidence and the circumstances relied upon by the courts below. \n 13. In a case based on circumstantial evidence it is always better for the courts to deal with each circumstance separately and then link the circumstances which have been proved to arrive at a conclusion. Unfortunately, in this case, though a reference has been made to some circumstances, the circumstances have not been discussed separately. Therefore, we propose to discuss the various circumstances relied upon by the prosecution: 1. LAST SEEN TOGETHER As far as this circumstance is concerned, the same stands proved. It is the case of all that Room No. 203 in Meena Guest House was hired by the two accused and the deceased. Venki came at about 9.30 p.m., but he left at 10.15 p.m. Thereafter the lodge was locked. Therefore, this circumstance is proved. Though this circumstance is proved, we must also look into the circumstances under which the accused were last seen together with the deceased. The case of the prosecution is that it is the accused who took the deceased to the room with the intention of killing him since the accused Siva suspected that R (PW10) was having an affair with the deceased. \nHowever, the manner in which the accused reached Chennai and the guest house in question suggests a total different story. The maternal uncle of the deceased (PW1) states that one Jeyaraj, an employee of PW5 informed him over the phone at about 6/7 p.m. on 30.10.2004 that the deceased Arun along with his friend Siddharth was coming to stay in the night with PW1 at Chennai. A few minutes later, PW1 talked to his nephew Arun, who also told him that he would be coming to his uncle's house but did not come. Siddharth is the son of Gomti Pandian (PW7). \nAccording to her, Siddharth told her that he was going to Chennai along with his friend Arun (deceased) to purchase some clothes. She was reluctant to send her son with his friend but then she talked to Arun who told her that they would be going to Chennai by bus and convinced her to send Siddharth with him. She dropped Siddharth at the bus stand. Later she came to know that her son Siddharth had gone to Chennai along with the deceased Arun and three other persons in a car which had met with an accident. She was informed about this by Kala Devi (PW8), whose son Mathesh had also travelled in the same car. \nThus, it is clear that it was Arun (deceased), who convinced Siddharth's mother to send Siddharth with him. This witness also stated that later her son informed her that the car had met with an accident and, thereafter, he and Mathesh did not proceed to Chennai and returned to their homes. PW8 states that her son Mathesh had told her that he was going to Coimbatore. Next morning she received a call from her brother's son. He told her that the car in which Mathesh was travelling had met with an accident. \nShe was also told that Mathesh along with his friends Siva, Chandru, Siddharth and Arun came to the house of her brother and thereafter Mathesh returned to home. Thus, it is clear that Siddharth and Mathesh were also travelling in the car and they would have also gone to Chennai but for the fact that the car met with an accident. Thereafter, Siddharth and Mathesh did not proceed further and returned to their homes. As such, it is clear that it was not the accused, who had organised the trip but it was the deceased, who had organised the trip and, therefore, it cannot be said that the accused had taken the deceased to the guest house with the intention of killing him. This assumption by both the courts below is based on no evidence. \n 2. MEDICAL EVIDENCE Medical evidence led in this case clearly indicates that the deceased died due to overdose of Tidijesic. It is not disputed that 4 ml of Tidijesic was injected into the wrist of the deceased by Venki, who administered 2 ml of the same substance into himself and thereafter the deceased died. \n   The evidence of Dr. R. Baskaran (PW11), who is Professor and Head of the Department of Legal and Forensic Medicines, Royapettai Government Hospital, Chennai clearly shows that after chemical analysis it was found that the amount of the offending substance found in the blood of the deceased would be equal to injecting 40 ml of Tidijesic. \nTherefore, there is no manner of doubt that the deceased died due to overdosing of drug. \n PW11 stated that if a 20 ml syringe is used then about 40 ml of Tidijesic could be injected in two attempts. However, if a 5 ml syringe is used, it would require 810 attempts. He clearly states that he cannot tell when and how this 40 ml Tidijesic was injected into the body of the deceased. He also could not state what time the death had occurred. He also stated that it takes 6 to 24 hours for the drug to take effect and this would further depend upon the quantity of the drug, the physique and the actions of the person injected. \nTherefore, his statement does not help us with regard to the time of death or with regard to the number of attempts in which the drug was injected into the body of the deceased. \nEven in the postmortem report the approximate time of death has not been indicated. Dr. A.N. Shanmugham (PW 6), who conducted the postmortem also could not say when the death took place. \n Dr. A.N. Shanmugham (PW6) in his statement had stated that injuries caused by the needle due to injection of medicine were found in fore arm, ankle of front foot, front and middle fore arm. He has been confronted with the post mortem report (PD5), in which there is mention of only two injection marks  one in front of left elbow joint and one in middle of left fore arm. It is clearly mentioned that no other external or internal injuries seen over the body. He has not been able to give a proper explanation why he did not mention other injuries in the postmortem report. This would mean that the deceased was injected only twice. \n It is the case of the prosecution that on the first occasion the deceased was injected with 4 ml Tidijesic. Therefore, 36 ml could not have been injected in one go on the next occasion. The police has not recovered any syringe or other material from the room. As per the prosecution case, the lodge was locked at about 10.30 p.m.. The next morning the deceased was found dead. No recoveries of any ampoules or syringe have been made from the accused or at their instance to connect them with the offence. \n The prosecution, by means of the aforesaid medical evidence, has failed to link the accused with the death of the deceased. The prosecution has failed to prove the exact time of death of the deceased. The deceased was first injected an injection between 9.30 p.m. to 10.00 p.m.. As per doctor, the effect of this could end in about six hours. \nTherefore, the possibility of the deceased getting up himself in the middle of the night to inject himself cannot be ruled out. There is also the possibility of his calling some other person to inject him with the drug. Even more importantly, the prosecution has failed to prove where the balance 36 ml of drug came from. Who got this drug and when? There is no evidence that the accused purchased this drug. No recovery has been made from them and, therefore, we are of the view that though it stands proved that the deceased died due to overdose of drug, the prosecution has miserably failed to link the accused with the death of the deceased. 3. MOTIVE The motive put forth is that R (PW10) was close to accused Siva, who introduced her to Arun. According to the case set up by the prosecution, the two had developed a close relationship and were regularly chatting with each other on phone and through SMSes. This was not liked by Siva (Accused No.1), who thereafter conspired with Chandru (Accused No. 2) to kill the deceased by overdosing him. R (PW10) in her statement has not at all supported the prosecution case and according to her, she had never met Arun but had talked to him over phone and that too occasionally. She also stated that she and the deceased Arun would exchange SMSes which were usual in nature. \n   She, in crossexamination, denied the suggestion that she used to talk to Arun every day. She stated that they talked generally about matters relating to college. She also denied that she had any special relationship with Siva. According to her, Siva was her friend being a collegemate. No other evidence has been led to prove that R (PW10) had any special relationship with accused Siva or that she had developed any special relationship with deceased Arun. The only evidence in this regard is the statement of R (PW10), which does not support the prosecution case at all. \n In this regard, it would also be pertinent to mention that in the first complaint filed by PW1, there is no mention of R (PW10), much less of her having any affair with either the accused or the deceased. This was brought out for the first time only in the complaint filed four years after the death of Arun. There is no explanation for this long silence of four years. Therefore, we are clearly of the view that the motive has not been proved. We must also remember that the accused and the deceased were good friends. They had studied for many years together and there is not even an iota of evidence about such love triangle. \n 4. CHANDRU WAS A MEDICAL STUDENT Both the courts below have come to the conclusion that Chandru was asked by Siva to commit the crime because Chandru was a medical student and he alone knew how to inject the substance into the body of the deceased. We are constrained to observe that the inference drawn by the courts below was totally ill founded. Why would Chandru kill another human being just on the asking of the accused Siva? Chandru was a medical student, studying in a profession meant to save lives and not to kill people. From the evidence on record it stands established that the deceased was a drug addict and had been taking injectible drugs for a long time. It is well known that such drug addicts can easily inject themselves. What has happened in this case is not clear but it cannot be said with certainty that Chandru had injected the poisonous substance into the body of the deceased. There is no evidence in this regard. \nAs we have discussed above, it was not only Siva and Chandru who were coming to Chennai with deceased Arun but Siddharth and Mathesh were also coming to Chennai in the same car. However, they went back only after the car met with an accident. All these boys were in their late teens or early 20s and two of them got scared after the accident and they went to the homes of their relatives and from there they contacted their respective mothers. Since they had obtained permission of their mothers by giving false excuses, they got scared and went back. Even as per the prosecution, Chandru had no motive to kill Arun. \nTherefore, the inference drawn by the High Court as well as the trial court that Siva and Chandru had conspired or had the common intention of murdering Arun is not based on any cogent or reliable evidence. 14. Other than the circumstances referred to above, there are other circumstances which go against the prosecution which we shall refer to now: 1. Inconsistency in the statement of PW1  PW1 is the maternal uncle of the deceased. In his first complaint made in the police station on 31.10.2004, there is no reference to R (PW10) or other facts which have been stated at a later stage. The private complaint filed by him four years later is contrary to the first complaint filed by him immediately after the occurrence. His explanation is that he was asked to sign on two blank papers by the police. First of all, we see no reason why the police in a case of this nature would try to help the accused and shield the actual criminal. Secondly, there is no material on record to show that PW1, the maternal uncle or PW 5, father of the deceased, ever complained to any authority that PW1 had been forced to sign two blank papers. This is a case where the maternal uncle and the father of the deceased had approached the High Court on at least two occasions for transfer of the investigation. \nThey succeeded once and failed on the second occasion. \nIn case the version of PW1 that his signatures were taken on blank papers was correct, then he would have definitely said so much earlier. He would have reported the matter to the higher authorities or made mention of this in the petitions filed in the High Court. Despite a pointed query to the counsel for the original complainant and the informant and the State they failed to point out whether any such complaint had been made by PW1 or PW5. Therefore, we do not accept the version of PW1 that his signatures were obtained on blank sheets of papers. This also casts a doubt on the veracity of the statement of PW1. 2. Delay in filing the private complaint   It is true that PW1 and PW5 were moving the High Court for transfer of the case to some other investigating agency but, at the same time, it would be pertinent to mention that after the chargesheet was filed against Venki by the Investigating Officer (DW4), neither PW1 nor PW5 filed any protest petition to the effect that the accused (appellants herein) should also be arraigned as accused. They let the matter go on and it was only after Venki died that the private complaint was filed. There is no explanation why no protest petition was filed when the police had only made out a case against accused Venki and that too under Section 304 IPC and not murder. 3. PW1 and PW5 are not coming to the Court with clean hands   The motive has been introduced after four years. The father and the maternal uncle of the deceased never brought up the issue of the deceased having conversations with R (PW10) at any earlier stage. \n           Therefore, PW1 and PW5 are not coming to the court with clean hands. They have cooked up the story of signing on blank papers and also cooked up the story relating to the motive. Therefore, their evidence is not reliable and a person cannot be convicted on the basis of such evidence. 15. All that is proved is that the deceased and the accused were sleeping in one room and the deceased died due to overdose of drug. The prosecution had miserably failed to prove that the accused injected this drug. It is the case of the prosecution that the first injection was administered by Venki, which was only 4 ml. There is possibility of the deceased injecting himself on the second occasion sometime in the middle of the night or early in the morning. In this context, we must remember that the doctor, who conducted the postmortem has not given any approximate time of death of the deceased which could have helped us in the matter. The circumstances proved cannot lead to the inference that it is the accused alone who committed the offence. In fact, the prosecution has even failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the death is homicidal in view of the inconsistencies in the medical evidence dealt by us above. Even otherwise, it is not proved that it was the accused who injected the deceased and the possibility of the accused injecting himself or some other person doing so cannot be ruled out. \n 16. In view of the above discussion we allow both the appeals, set aside the judgment dated 30.11.2010 of the High Court in Criminal Appeal No.592 of 2010 and 636 of 2010 and judgment dated 24.09.2010 of the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.V, Chennai in S.C. No.237 of 2009. The accusedappellants are acquitted. They are directed to be released immediately unless required in any other case. Pending application(s), if any, stand(s) disposed of. ..............................J.\n (SANJAY KISHAN KAUL) ..............................J.\n                          (DEEPAK GUPTA) New Delhi February 12 , 2019",

JUDGMENT: \n         CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. \n 420 of 1974. \n Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated 27-11-74 of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 2646/73 and Referred No. 95/73. \n Frank Anthony, E.C. Agarwala and A. T. M. Sampath; for the Appellants. \n O.P. Rana; for the Respondent. \n The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD, J. The appellants, Subhash and Shyam Narain, were convicted by the learned Civil and Sessions Judge, Farrukhabad under section 302 of the Penal Code on the charge that at about 9 a.m. on June 9, 1972 they committed the murder of one Ram Sanehi. Subhash was sentenced to death and Shyam Narain to imprisonment for life. The judgment of the trial court having been confirmed in appeal by the High Court of Allahabad, the two accused have filed this appeal by special leave of this Court. The case of the prosecution is briefly as follows: on the morning of June 9, 1972 the deceased Ram Sanehi had gone to his field along with his son Bal Kishore and his daughter Kusuma Devi for eating Kharbuzas. While they were returning from the field at about 9 a.m. the appellants, who were lying in wait near a culvert, suddenly accosted Ram Sanehi. The Appeallent Subhash pointed the barred of his gun towards the chest of Ram Sanehi and said that since he, Ram Sanehi, was a witness against him in a complaint filed by Pooran Lal and since he was also doing Pairvi on behalf of Pooran Lal he would not be allowed to remain alive. The appellant Shyam Narain was armed     with a lathi. Bal Kishore and Kusuma Devi pleaded with the appellants to spare their father but Shyam Narain asked Subhash not to delay the matter and finish Ram Sanehi quickly. Subhash thereupon fired three shots from his double-barrelled gun, the last of which misfired. Ram Sanehi fell down, whereupon the appellants dragged him by his legs over a distance of 6 or 7 paces. Bal Kishore and Kusuma Devi then raised an alarm whereupon Brij Bhusan, Shyam Lal Mangali Prasad and Jhabbo Singh Thakur reached the place of occurecnce and challenged the appellants. Before running away, the appellant Subhash told his companion Shyam Narain that he on his own part was going to surrender before a court and that Shyam Narain should make his own arrangements. Ram Sanehi died within about 10 minutes after receiving the injuries. \n Bal Kishore first went to his house which is at about a distance of 120 yards from the scene of offence. At about 12 o'clock at noon he went to the Kamalgani police station and lodged his First Information Report (Ex. Ka-3). S.I.\n Vishwanath Sharma who was posted as a 2nd officer at the police station recorded Bal Kishore's complaint. went to the scene of occurrence, prepared the inquest report and handed over the dead body for being sent for post-mortem examination to the District Hospital at Farrukhabad which is about 10 miles away form the village of Kandharpur where the incident took place. S.I Sharma took samples of earth from the place of occurrence an seized a mis fired cartridge which was lying concealed in the folds of the deceased's Dhoti. The Fard in that behalf is Ex. Ka-10 and the site- plan is Ex. Ka-11.\n  The appellant Subhash surrendered before the Additional District Magistrate (Judicial) at Farrukhabad at about 4 p.m. on the very day. The appellant Shyam Narain was arrested at about 2-40 p.m. on the same day under section 122 of the Railway Act for crossing The railines at Fatehgarh. \n The appellants denied the charge that they had committed the murder- of Ram Sanehi and stated that they were involved in the case due to enmity. This defence has been rejected both by the Sessions Court and the High Court. \n Before referring to the evidence in the case it has to be mentioned that the High Court had before it not only the appeal filed by the accused but also a reference made by the Sessions Court for confirma tion of the capital sentence under section 374 of the Code of CriminalProcedure. Time and again this Court has pointed out that on a reference for confirmation of the sentence of death, the High Court is under an obligation to proceed in accordance with the provisions of sections 375 and 376 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Under these sections the High Court must not only see whether the order passed by the Sessions Court is correct but it is under an obligation to examine the entire evidence for itself, apart from and independently of the Sessions Court's appraisal and assessment of that evidence. \nFrom the long line of decisions which have taken this view it would be enough to refer to the decisions in Jumman and ors. v. The State of Punjab, Ram Shanker Singh & ors. v.\nState of West Bengal and Bhupendra Singh v. The State of Punjab.\n  The High Court has failed to show due regard to this well-established position in law. It did not undertake a full and independent examination of the evidence led in the case and it mainly contented itself with finding out whether the Sessions Court had in any manner erred in reaching the conclusion that the charge of murder levelled against the appellants was established beyond a reasonable doubt. The High Court is right in saying that the main question in the case was whether Bal Kishore and Kusuma Devi who were examined as eye-witnesses were truthful witnesses. But then it did not subject their evidence to any minute scrutiny. \nImpressed overbearingly by the circumstance that the Sessions Court \"had the opportunity of observing the demeanour\" of the witnesses, the High Court apparenty thought that such an opportunity gave to the Sessions Court's judgment a mystical weight and authority, even though the learned Sessions Judge had not, in his judgment or while recording the evidence, made any special reference to the demeanour of the witnesses. The High Court accepted the evidence of Ram Sanehi's children by observing that there was no material contradiction ill their evidence and that certain statements in the F.I.R. afforded a guarantee that the two witnesses were present when their father was done to death. We will now proceed to show how several significant circumstances either escaped the attention of the High Court or were not given their due and rightful importance. First as to the manner in which S.I. Sharma conducted investigation into the case. The offence took place at about 9 a.m. on June 9 and though the District Hospital at Farrukaabad was just 10 miles away, the dead body was not received at the hospital for nearly 24 hours after the incident had taken place. The excuse offered by the prosecution that cartman was not willing to take the body at night is utterly flimsy because the Investigating officer could have easily made some alternate arrangement for despatchin the dead body for postmortem examination expeditiously. With the dead body lying at the scene of offence for nearly 12 hours and thereafter at the police station for another 8 or 9 hours, it was easy enough for the witnesses to mould their statements so as to accord with the nature of injuries. The lnvestigating Officer did not make any note at all in the General Diary as to which witnesses were examined by him on the date of the occurrence which was obligatory upon him to do under paragraph 44 of the U.P. Police Act. \nThe time when the investigation was commenced and the time when it was concluded are not mentioned in the case diary. \nThe time when the Investigating officer reached the village and the time when he returned to the police station are also not noted in the case diary. S.I. Sharma stated in his evidence that several important facts concerning the investigation were being stated by him in his evidence from memory. He reached the scene of offence at about 2-30 p.m.\nbut it was not until about 6 p.m. that he inspected the site. The dead body was not removed from the scene of offence till about 9 p.m. and even that is open to grave doubt because the Investigating officer has admitted in his evidence that he was unable to say as to when the dead body was taken way from the spot and whether it was taken directly to the hospital or was detained somewhere on the way. He was unable to say whether it was right or wrong that the dead body remained in the village till about 4 'O'clock on the morning of the 10th. Forty or fifty persons had gathered at the scene of offence when the Investigating officer arrived but the record of the case does not show that the statement of any of those persons was ever recorded. In fact even the statement of Kusuma Devi was recorded late at night for which the reason is stated to be that her elder sister Pushpa Devi died of shock on the evening of the 9th after hearing of her father's murder. It may be that Pushpa Devi died on the 9th, but apart from the cause of her death, the statement of Kusuma Devi need not have been held up so long. We are doubtful if the Investigating officer at all knew on the 9th that Pushpa Devi had died. He has admitted that his knowledge in that behalf was derived from hearsay reports. The appellant Subhash had surrendered before the Additional District Magistrate, Farrukhabad on the afternoon of the 9th itself while the other appellant Shyam Narain was arrested at Fatehgarh at about 2-40 p.m. The Investigating officer did not even know of these significant developments, though they had taken place just a few miles away from the scene of investigation. He says that he learnt of the surrender and the arrest of the appellants on the evening of the 12th. \nMangali Prasad has been examined by the prosecution as an eye-witness and his name is mentioned in the F.I.R. as one of the four persons who arrived at the scene of offence even before the appellants had run away. His statement was recorded 11 days later on June 20. The F.I.R. mentions expressly that the appellants caught hold of the legs of the deceased and started dragging him. The Investigating officer has not stated in the Panchnama of the scene of offence whether the ground was soft or hard or sandy which had great relevance on the allegation that the deceased was dragged over a certain distance. Finally, it is surprising that the Investigating officer did not think it worthwhile to pay a visit to the field where the deceased is alleged to have gone with his children for eating Kharbuzas. Indeed he stated that he was not in a position to say if there were Kharbuzas at all in the field, when the occurrence took place. \n         The High Court has condoned these lapses on the part of the Investigating officer with the observation that he \"appears to have been inexperienced and somewhat negligent\".\n  The Investigating officer has stated in his evidence that he had put in 7 years of service. It is difficult to understand on what basis the High Court attributed the lapses on his part to mere inexperience. We will presently indicate the significance of the various lapses and loopholes in investigation but to say, as the High Court has done, that the Investigating Officer was \"somewhat negligent\" seems to us in the circumstances a grave euphemism. \n We will now proceed to deal with the various circumstances which, in our opinion, render it unsafe to accept the prosecution case. \n Dr. S.C. Pandiya who performed the post-mortem examination has described in his evidence the injuries received by Ram Sanehi. In all he found 7 injuries on the dead body, out of which injuries 1, 3 and 7, injuries 2 and 4, and injuries 5 and 6 are interconnected. Injury No. 1 is described as a \"shot wound\" with its entry above the left nipple. Injury No. 3 is described as multiple rounded abrasions on the left side of the chest. Injury No. 7 is the wound of exit on the right scapular region, corresponding to injury No. 1. rnjury No. 2 consists of 8 gunshot wounds of entry below the right nipple while injury No. 4 consists of multiple rounded abrasions above the right nipple. Injury No. 5 is a gun-shot wound of entry on the back of the left forearm while injury No. 6 is the corresponding wound of exit near the ulnar aspect of the left forearm. \n The evidence of Dr. Pandiya and the description of the injuries given by him in the post-mortem report tend to show that two different kinds of firearms were used by the assailants of Ram Sanehi. Injury No. 1 was caused by a bullet and that is clear not only from the description of the injury but from what Dr. Pandiya has stated in his evidence. He says: \"The bullet, which had entered through injury No. 1 went out straight after emerging from injury No. 7\". Injuries Nos. 2 and 5 were caused by pellets. This shows that whereas injury No. 1 was caused by a firearm in the nature of a rifle, injuries 2 and 5 were caused by an ordinary gun. The medical evidence thus falsifies the eye- witnesses' account according to which, the appellant Subhash alone was armed with a double-barrelled gun, the other appellant Shyam Narain being armed with a lathi. The objective inference arising from the nature of injuries received by the deceased has a significant impact on the case of the prosecution, which has been overlooked by both the Sessions Court and the High Court. \n While we are on the medical evidence it would be appropriate to mention that there was no tatooing or charring on any of the firearm injuries which, according to the doctor, shows that the firing was done from a distance of more than 4 feet. In the First Information Report Bal Kishore has stated that as soon as he, his father and sister, reached the culvert, Subhash \"touching the chest\" of Ram Sanehi \"with thebarrel of his gun\" said that he shall not leave him alive; Shyam Narain thereupon exhorted Subhash not to delay and fire immediately; Subhash then fired three shots in quick succession, one of which mishred. The trend of the F.I.R. is that Subhash fired the first two shots at Ram Sanehi from a point blank range, in which event indisputably, there would have been tatooing and charring around the injuries. Bal Kishore has attempted to offer an explanation that what he meant to say in his compaint was that Subhash trained his gun \"towards\" Ram Sanehi's chest and not \"on\" his chest. \nThis explanation is an after thought and in the circumstances difficult to accept. Thus in another important respect, the medical evidence falsifies the case of the prose cution. \n There is another aspect of the medical evidence which, though, not as important as the two aspects mentioned above, may also be referred to. The case of the prosecution is that Ram Sanehi had gone to his Kharbuza field with his son and daughter for eating Kharobuzsas. There is evidence that they did eat Kharbuzas and almost immediately there after they started back for home. Within less than 5 minutes, Ram Sanehi met with his deat near the culvert. The post-mortem report shows that Ram Sanehi's stomach was empty which means that the evidence that he had eaten Kharbuzas just a little time before his death is untrue. Bal Kishore tried to wriggle out of this situation by saying that Ram Sanehi had eaten just a small slice of Kharbuza. But even there, Dr.\nPandiya has stated that if the entire slice of Kharbuza was eaten by Ram Sanehi, its remains would be found in the stomach provided there was no vomiting after the gun-shot injuries. Since Ram Sanehi had not vomited, his large intestines could not have been found to be empty if the story of his children was true. \n This last circumstance may at first sight seem trivial but its importance consists in the fact that the visit of Ram Sanehi, along with his children, to the Kharbuza field for the purpose of eating Kharbuzas is the very genesis of the incident which happened on June 9, 1972. Coupled with the circumstance that the Investigating officer did not even pay a visit to the Kharbuza field, leave alone making a Panchnama thereof, the conclusion is irresistible that the story that the children had accompanied their father to the Kharbuza field lacks a factual basis. The other circumstances which render the prosecution case suspect are these (1) Ram Sanehi is alleged to have been drageed over 6 or 7 paces by the appellants but not even an abrasion was found on his back or stomach which could be attributed to dragging. (2) Thirty or forty persons are alleged to have collected at the sence of occurrence but Bal Kishore was not able to mention the name of even one of them and it is common ground that the Investigating officer did not record the statement of any of them. (3) Jhabboo Singh, Shyam Lal Brij Bhushan and Mangali Prasad reached the scene of offence even before the appellants had fled away but none from amongst the first three was examined by the prosecution. Mangali Prasad was examined as an eye-witness but he has been concurrently disbelieved by the Sessions Court and the High Court. (4) Though the motive of the offence is alleged to be that in a complaint filed by Pooran Lal against the appellant Subhash, the deceased Ram Sanehi was cited as a witness, Mangali Prasad's evidence shows that immediately after the firing, Bal Kishore told him that Ram Sanehi was murdered because of the disputes concerning the election to the Pradhanki. What Bal Kishore told Mangali Prasad immediately after the incident seems more probable because, one Virendrapal had contested that election and the appellant Subhash had defeated him. When Bal Kishore went to lodge his F.I.R. at the police station he was accompanied by Virendrapal, though an attempt was made to show that Virendrapal was only standing outside the police station and had met-Bal Kishore accidently. (5) The story of Bal Kishore that after the appellant Subhash fired 2 shots he re-loaded his gun but the re-loaded cartridge misured makes hardly any sense. Subhash was armed with a double barrelled gun and having fired 2 fatal shots from a close range at his target, it is unlikely that he would re-load the gun and that too with only one cartridge. And if that cartridge misfired, it is impossible to understand how it could be found concealed in the folds of Ram Sanehi's dhoti. \n There is only one other aspect of the matter which remains to be considered and since the High Court has placed great reliance thereon, it is necessary to deal with it. The F.I.R. which lodged at about 12 O'clock at noon on the 9th itself mentions that after Ram Sanehi was murdered, the appellant Subhash told his companion Shyam Narain that he himself was going to surrender before a court and that Shyam Narain should make his own arrangement. In fact, Subhash did surrender in the court of the Additional District Magistrate, Farrukhabad, at about 4 p.m. on the 9th. What the High Court has over-looked is that Subhash did not surrender in connection with the murder of Ram Sanehi but he surrendered along with the 13 or 14 other accused against whom Pooran Lal had filed a complaint. In so far as Shyam Narain is concerned, the High Court is wrong in saying that he managed somehow to get himself arrested. The evidence of Constable Virendra Singh shows that Shyam Narain was arrested because he was crossing the railway lines and if he was not caught, he would have been run over by the two trains coming from Kanpur and Farrukhabad. This was hardly any sensible way of making an \"arrangement\" for himself, as directed by Subhash. It is therefore not as if the statement attributed to Subhash in the F.I.R. is corroborated by subsequent events so as to afford a guarantee to Bal Kishore's presence at the culvert. \n We are conscious that the Sessions Court and the High Court have both held that the appellants committed the murder of Ram Sanehi but the weight of the circumstances which we have discussed above is so preponderating that even the concurrent finding cannot be allowed to stand. In any event, it seems to us impossible to hold that the prosecution has established its case beyond a reasonable doubt. \n We therefore allow this appeal, set aside the order of conviction and sentence recorded by the High Court and the Sessions Court and direct that the appellants shall be set at liberty.\n M.R.                                      Appeal allowed.",

MOHITE, JJ .\n\n            DATED: 29TH JANUARY 2008 \n\nORAL JUDGMENT  (PER F.I.REBELLO, J.): .   Rule. By consent of parties heard forthwith. \n 2.  The petitioner is aggrieved by the action of the 1st respondent in taking steps to sell of the land and house standing thereon which according to the petitioner is of his ownership and stands in his name. It is the case of the petitioner that the respondents are seeking to recover tax dues of his father for the block years 1986-96 and considering the explanation to Section 222(1) of the Income Tax Act, that action is without jurisdiction.\n 3.  The petitioner's case is as under:- The property was purchased on 3rd December, 1974 when the petitioner was a minor in his name by his father. A house was constructed thereon somewhere in 1979-80. The petitioner was born on 25th October, 1969. The property and the property along with the house is shown as standing in the petitioner's name atleast since the year 1979-80. \n The petitioner on attaining majority effected necessary corrective entries on 25th October, 1988 in the record of Khopoli Nagar Parishad as well as the record of the Tahsildar at Khopoli. \n 4.  There was a search and seizure operation conducted under Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 against the petitioner's father on 28th March, 1996. During the search an amount of Rs.9,556/- and jewellery of the value of Rs.1,08,200/- was found. \n In pursuance of the said search an order under Section 158BC of the Income Tax Act was passed. Pursuant to the said order the petitioner's father Shri John Oomen was treated as a defaulter and the Department has served on the petitioner's father notice of demand treating him as a defaulter under the Income Tax Act. On 5th March, 2002 the 1st respondent issued a I.T.C.P.-16 on petitioner's father attaching the petitioner's property Oomen Villa for tax dues of the petitioner's father. The Respondent No.1 in February, 2007 issued I.T.C.P.17 under Rule 53 of the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Rules 1961 i.e. notice for settling a sale proclamation regarding the petitioner's property. The petitioner on being informed about the sale by his father, by letter of 7th April, 2007 filed his objections before the 1st respondent contending that the action of attaching and further proceedings for auction sale were illegal. According to the petitioner on 22nd August, 2007 the 1st respondent issued a summons under Section 131 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to the petitioner asking him to appear and produce relevant documents for substantiating the petitioner's claim of ownership. In pursuance of the summons the petitioner appeared and produced the relevant documents. \n .  By an order of 21st September, 2007 which was received by the petitioner on 11th October, 2007 the petitioner was informed that his objections were rejected and the auction proceedings are being initiated in respect of the attached property to recover the arrears of tax dues. Petitioners contention is that Section 222 of the Income Tax Act would not apply and consequently the action of the respondents is without authority of law. Hence the reliefs as prayed for. \n .  Reply has been filed by Elsy Mathew, Tax Recovery Officer. It is contended that the property was inherited property and not self acquired property. Reliance is placed on the explanation to Section 222(1) of the Income Tax Act. Based on that it is set out that the respondents are entitled to in law to attach and sale the property. \n 5.  The questions for our consideration are:- 1. Does the purchase in the name of the minor son amount to a transfer within the meaning of the explanation to Section 222(1)? \n 2. If on fact it is found that the house was constructed on the land in the year 1979-80 and stands in the name of the petitioner much before a demand was made on his father for the year 1986-96, whether the petitioner in whose name the house and the property stands was liable and the property and house could be attached and sold. \n 6.  To answer the first quesltion, for our consideration we may gainfully refer to the provisions of Section 222(1) which reads as under:- \"222(1) When an assessee is in default or is deemed to be in default in making a payment of tax, the Tax Recovery Officer may draw up under his signature a statement in the prescribed form specifying the amount of arrears due from the assessee (such statement being hereinafter in this Chapter and in the Second Schedule referred to as \"certificate\") and shall proceed to recover from such assessee the amount specified in the certificate by one or more of the modes mentioned below, in accordance with the rules laid down in the Second Schedule--- (a) attachment and sale of the assesee's movable property. \n (b) attachment and sale of the assesee's immovable property; (c) arrest of the assessee and his detention in prison; (d) appointing a receiver for the management of the assessee's movable and immovable properties. \n Explanation:- For the purposes of this sub-section, the assessee's movable or immovable property shall include any property which has been transferred, directly or indirectly on or after the 1st day of June, 1973, by the assessee to his spouse or minor child or son's wife or son's minor child, otherwise than for adequate consideration, and which is held by, or stands in the name of any of the persons aforesaid; and so far as the movable or immovable property so transferred to his minor child or his son's minor child is concerned, it shall, even after the date of attainment of majority by such minor child or son's minor child, as the case may be, continue to be included in the assessee's movable or immovable property for recovering any arrears due from the assessee in respect of any period prior to such date.\" \n .  A perusal of the explanation on which reliance has been placed on behalf of the revenue, would contemplate that the movable or immovable property has been transferred directly or indirectly on or after the 1st day of June, 1973, by the assessee to his spouse or minor child or son's wife or son's minor child, otherwise than for adequate consideration, and which is held by, or stands in the name of any of the persons aforesaid; and so far as the movable or immovable property so transferred to his minor child or his son's minor child is concerned, it shall, even after the date of attainment of majority by such minor child or son's minor child, as the case may be, continue to be included in the assessee's movable or immovable property for recovering any arrears due from the assessee in respect of any period prior to such date.\n .       It would be, therefore, clear that there must be a transfer of property on or after 1st June, 1973 in favour of the minor child. In the instant case as we have noted earlier the property was purchased in the name of the petitioner who was then a minor. Does purchase in the name of minor amount to a transfer within the meaning of the explanation to Section 222(1). Transfer is defined for the purpose of capital assets under Section 2(47) of the Income Tax Act and includes sale, exchange or relinquishment of the assets or extinguishment of any right. The other sub-clauses need not be adverted to. It is, therefore, clear that the transfer would include  sale, exchange or relinquishment of the assets. In the instant case the property was purchased in the name of the minor as in law a minor cannot contract. That purchase was in the year 1974. The property continued to be in the name of the minor. The dictionary meaning of \"transfer\" in K.J. Aiyar's Judicial Dictionary reads amongst others as under:- \"Transfer must carry with it \"from\" and \"to\". In case either of them is wanting, there can be no transfer.\"\n .    In our opinion, therefore, considering the definition of transfer and the dictionary meaning of transfer, on the facts of this case there would be no transfer in so far as the immovable property is concerned. \n 9.  The next aspect of the matter is of the house standing on the said property. There is no material to show that the income from which the house was constructed. The fact, however, remains that the house stands in the records in the name of the petitioner right from the year 1979-80. This fact is not disputed by Revenue. Even otherwise the learned Counsel for the petitioner has placed before us the revenue records indicating and which would raise a presumption that the property with the structure (house) atleast from the assessment year 1979-80 stands in the name of the petitioner herein. \n There is no material to show that at any point of time that the house was shown in the name of the petitioner's father. This would be one aspect of the matter. The other aspect of the matter is even assuming that the house was constructed by the father the transfer in terms of the explanation must be for recovery of the tax arrears of the father for a period prior to the date of the transfer. The father's dues are for the block assessment years 1986-96. The house stands in the name of the son from 1979-80. In our opinion, therefore, considering these facts on record it cannot be said that there has been a gift or exchange or transfer by any other means of the house which would fall within the explanation and consequent thereto respect of which the respondents could have attached and sold the houseand property. \n 8.  We are, therefore, clearly of the opinion that the proposed sale of the land and the house by Respondent No.1 is without the authority of law.\n .   In the light of that petition made absolute in terms of prayer clauses (a) and (b). In the circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs. (R.S.MOHITE, J.)   (F.I.REBELLO, J.)",

In respect of its assessment to, income tax\nfor certain years, it was allowed 'initial depreciation' on\nnew machinery 'installed in the relevant previous years and\nwas also allowed 'normal depreciation' at appropriate rates. \nIn the assessment year 1956-57 the aggregate of all\ndepreciation allowances including 'initial depreciation'\nexceeded the original cost of machinery but in respect of\nthat year as well as for the assessment years 1957-58 and\n1958-59, the Income Tax Officer failed to deduct 'initial\ndepreciation and the company was allowed 'normal\ndepreciation' in, excess of the amount permissible under\nproviso (c) to s. 10(2)(vi) of the Income Tax Act, 1922. On November 20, 1964, the Income Tax Officer issued notices\nof reassessment for the three years under section 148 of the\nIncome Tax Act,. 1961. The Company filed returns under\nprotest and thereafter challenged the notices of re-\nassessment by a writ petition under Art. 226 of the\nConstitution. It was common ground that excessive\ndepreciation was in fact allowed to the Company and that\ncertain income escaped assessment, but it was contended on\nbehalf of the appellant that the income did not escape\nassessment \"by reason of the omission or failure on the part\nof the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material\nfacts necessary for assessment of that year\". A Single\n Judge of the High Court held that while the Company\ncommitted no error in failing to take into account the\n'initial depreciation' while entering the written down value\nin its return, it was not open to the Company to set out\nonly those facts which exaggerated its claim. He therefore\nrejected the petition. In dismissing a Letters Patent\nappeal, the High Court took the view that there was\napparently \"a mistake and error on the side of the Company\nas well as the Income Tax Officer\" and that the Income Tax\nOfficer could reasonably come to the conclusion that it was\n\ndue to the omission and failure on the part of the assessee\nin disclosing fully and truly all material facts necessary\nfor the assessment that the error was committed by the\nIncome Tax Officer as a result of Which some income had\nescaped assessment. \nOn, an appeal,\nHELD : The judgment of the High Court must be set aside and\nthe case remanded. \nAlthough the High Court held that the Income Tax Officer had\ndecided that certain income had escaped assessment, it did\nnot consider whether the income escaped assessment by reason\nof omission or failure on the part of the Company to\ndisclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for\nassessment, within the meaning of section 34 of the 1922\nAct. [596 F]\nCalcutta Discount Co. Ltd. v. Income Tax officer, Companies\nDistrict 1, Calcutta and Anr., 41 I.T.R. 191; referred to. \n\nJUDGMENT:\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 890 to 892 of 1968. Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated November 24, 1967 of the Allahabad High Court in Special Appeals Nos. 476 to 478 of 1965. \nS. T. Desai, H. K. Puri and B. N. Kirpal, for the appellant (in all the appeals). \nSukumar Mitra, S. C. Manchanda, R. H. Dhebar, R. N. Sachthey and B. D. Sharma, for the respondent (in all the appeals). \nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by Shah, J M/s Modi Spinning & Weaving Mills Co. Ltd.\nhereinafter called 'the Company'-was incorporated in 1946. From time to time the Company purchased and installed machi- nery of the value of Rs. 75 lakhs for its factory. In proceedings for assessment of income-tax, the Company was allowed, in computing its income from business for the assessment years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53 \"initial depreciation\" aggregating to Rs. 15,91,51 1/- in respect of new machinery installed in the relevant previous years. The Company was also allowed \"normal depreciation I' at the appropriate rates. In the assessment year 1956-57 the aggregate of all depreciation allowances including \"initial depreciation\" exceeded the original cost of the machinery, but the Income-tax Officer on the written down value of the machinery computed at Rs. 16,48,053/- allowed Rs. 2,59,236/- as normal depreciation. In so computing the normal depreciation the Income-tax Officer apparently lost sight of clause (c) of the proviso to s. 10(2) (vi) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. Depreciation allowance was also allowed in the assessment years 1957-58 and 1958-59 as a percentage on the appropriate written down value in those years. The Income- tax Officer on November 20, 1964, issued notices of re- assessment for the three years under s. 148 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961, which had replaced the Act of 1922. \nThe Company filed under protest fresh returns and objected to the issue of the notices of reassessment. \nThe Company also moved petitions in the High Court of Allahabad for writs quashing the three notices,. contending inter alia, that the notices issued more than four years after the expiry of the years of assessment were barred. At the hearing of the petitions counsel for the Company conceded that under proviso (c) to s. 10 (2) (vi) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, in the form in which it stood in the assessment year 1956-57 and thereafter, excessive depreciation was in fact allowed to the Company. It was also common ground that by virtue of cl. (c) to Explana-tion 1 of s. 147 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, income having been made the subject matter of excessive relief under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, the income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment. But it was urged that the income had not escaped assessment \"by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly, all material facts necessary for assessment of that year\", for-(1) the Indian Income-tax Art, 1922, and the forms of returns prescribed under the rules did not require the, assessee to disclose that initial depreciation had been allowed in the earlier years; and (2) that in any event the Income-tax Officer knew that initial depreciation had been allowed to the Company in the years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53. R. S. Pathak, J., who heard the petitions held that the Company committed no error in failing to take into account the initial depreciation while entering the written down value in column (2) of Part V of the return. But the learned Judge held that it was. incumbent upon the Company to inform the Income-tax Officer of all material facts necessary to make out its claim to depreciation and it was not open to the Company to set out only those facts which exaggerated its claim : the Company was bound to disclose all material facts which went to show what the true amount of the allowance to which it was entitled. The learned Judge accordingly rejected the petitions. The order passed by Pathak, J., was confirmed in appeal under the Letters Patent. By cl. (vi) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Income-tax Act, 1922, as amended by Act 8 of 1946, in computing the profits or gains. of business, profession or vocation carried on by him, an assessee was entitled to allowances not only of normal depreciation but also initial depreciation at the rates set out in cls. (a), (b) & (c) in respect of buildings which had been newly erected, or the machinery or plant being new had been installed after the 3 1st day of March, 1945. It was, however, expressly enacted that the initial depreciation was not deductible in determining the written down value for the purpose of cl. (vi). Allowance for initial depreciation was therefore not to be taken into account in determining the written down value for determining the normal depreciation. But on that account proviso (c) to s. 10 (2) (vi) was not modified. The written down value of the machinery of the, Company in the year 1956-57 was Rs. 16,48,053, but 'for the application of cl. (c) of the proviso to s. 10(2) (vi) the initial depreciation allowed in the years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952- 53 had to be taken into account. The Income-tax Officer inadvertently failed to take into account the initial depreciation, and the Company was allowed normal depreciation in the year 1956-57 in excess of the amount permissible under proviso (c) to s. 10(2) (vi). TheIncome-tax Officer later sought to rectify the error and to bring to tax the income which had escaped tax. \nBefore R. S. Pathak, I., it was contended that the definition of written down value\" in s. 10(5) (b) applies wherever the expression is used in s. 10(2) and on that account the Company in seting out the written down value in column (2) of Part V of the return was obliged to take into account all the depreciation actually allowed to it including the initial depreciation and as the Company computed the written down value only by deducting the normal depreciation and not the initial depreciation, it failed to' disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the purpose of assessment. This argument was not accepted by the learned Judge. But he was still of the opinion that the Act imposed upon the Company a duty to disclose all material facts which went to show the true amount of the allowances to which it was entitled, and the Company by failing to disclose that initial depreciation had been allowed in three earlier years , the Company had failed to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment, and on that account s. 147 ( 1 )(a) was attracted and the, notice was properly issued. \nIn appeal, the High Court observed that the \"only question for consideration\" was whether the Income-tax Officer was justified in issuing a notice under s. 148 of the Income-tax Act, 1961. After stating that there was apparently \"a mistake and error on the side of the Company as well as the Income-tax Officer\", the, Court observed that the Income-tax Officer could reasonably comer to the conclusion that it was due to the omission and failure on the part of the assessee in disclosing fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment that the error was committed by the Income-tax Officer as a result of which some income had es- caped assessment. The High Court then observed : \"It is difficult to hold that the Income-tax Officer while issuing the notices under Act could not reasonably hold the assessee was responsible for assessment.\", and held that the notices were not Section 34(1) (a) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, provided: \" (1) if- (a) the Income-tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return of his income under section 22 for any year or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year,                         income, profits or, gains chargeable to income-tax have escaped assessment for that year, or have been under assessed, or assessed at too low a rate, or have been made the subject of excessive relief under the Act, or excessive loss or depreciation allowance has been computed, or he may proceed to assess or re-assess such income, profits or gains or re-compute the loss or depreciation allowance; and the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub-section :\"\nSection 34 confers jurisdiction upon the Income-tax Officer to 'issue a notice in respect of the assessment beyond the period of four years, but within a period of eight years, from the end. of the relevant year, if two conditions exist (1) that the Income-tax Officer has reason to believe that income, profits or gains chargeable to income-tax had been under-assessed; and (2) that he has also reason to believe that such \"under.-assessment\" had occurred by reason of either (i) omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return of his income under s. 22, or (ii) omission or failure on the part of an assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year. These ,conditions are cumulative and precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction to issue a notice of re- assessment : Calcutta Discount Co. Ltd. v. Income-tax Officer, Companies District 1, Calcutta and Anr. (1) In deciding the appeal, the High Court held that the Income-tax Officer did in fact decide that the income had escaped assessment, but the High Court did not consider whether the income escaped assessment by reason of omission or failure on the part of the Company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary. for assessment. The judgment of the High Court is set aside and the case is remanded for determination of the question whether by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the Company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment of the Company for the three years in question, any income, profits or gains chargeable to income-tax have escaped assessment or the ,Company has been given excessive depreciation allowance in computing its income.\n Costs of these appeals will be costs in the High Court.

The pipes are rein-\n              forced concrete pipes. The U.P. Government issued a noti-\n              fication under the U.P. Sales Tax Act providing that \"sani-\n              tary fittings\" were to be taxed at 7 per cent instead of 2\n              per cent. The Saks Tax Officer treated hume pipes supplies\n              by the respondent as sanitary fittings and imposed sales tax\n              @ 7 per cent. The respondent filed a writ petition in the\n              High Court assailing the order of the Sales Tax Officer on\n              the ground that the hume pipes manufactured by the assessee\n              could not by. any stretch of imagination he construed to be\n              sanitary fittings nor were they ever used as such. The High\n              Court after perusing the materials on record and hearing\n              counsel accepted the plea of the respondent and held that\n              the hume pipes could not be treated as sanitary fittings. \n              The High Court accordingly quashed the assessment made by\n              the Sales Tax Officer. The respondent also filed certifi-\n              cates of Local Self Government Engineering Department, U.P.\n              to show that the pipes supplied by the respondent were\n              not used as sanitary fittings. The said certificate has\n              been signed by the Executive Engineer on behalf of the'\n              Chief Engineer of the department. \n\n                                        In an appeal by certificate the appellant\n                                        contended: \n\n                                               (1) High Court should not have entertained\n                                        the writ petition and should have allowed the\n                                        assessee to avail of the remedies provided to\n                                        him under the U.P. Sales Tax Act particularly\n                                        when question of fact had to be determined.\n\n                                               (2) On merits the conclusion of the High\n\n\n                     Court that hume pipes are nOt sanitary fit-\n\n                     tings is erroneous, Dismissing the appeal by\n\n                     certificate. \n\n     Held:(1) The Court negatived the contention of the\n\nappellant that the High Court ought not to have entertained\n\nthe writ petition and should have allowed the assessee to\n\navail of the remedies provided to him under the U.P. Sales\n\nTax Act. In the present case, whether the hume pipes\n\nmanufactured and sold by the respondent were sanitary fir-\n\nings was a question of law and since the entire material on\n\nthe basis of which this question could be determined was\n\nplaced before the Sales Tax Officer and had pointed in one\n\nand only one direction, namely, that the hume pipes were not\n\nsanitary fittings and there was nothing to show otherwise,\n\nthe High Court was justified in entertaining the writ\n\npetition. There is no rule of law that the High Court\n\nshould not entertain a writ petition where an alternative\n\nremedy is available to a party. It is always a matter of\n\ndiscretion and if the discretion has not been exercised by\n\nthe High Court unreasonably or perversely, it is the settled\n\npractice of this Court not to interfere with the exercise\n\nof discretion by the High Court. In these circumstances\n\nthis Court would not be justified in the interest of justice\n\nto interfere under Article 136 of the Constitution to quash\n\nthe order of the High Court merely on that ground after\n\nhaving found that the order was legally correct. [124\n\nB-E]\n\n     (2) It is well-settled that in construcing the articles\n\nused for business purposes the terms must be interpreted in\n\na purely commercial sense.

Planters Nut and Chocolate Company Ltd.,\n\n(1951) Canada L.R.. Ex. Court 122. 126 approved. So construed by sanitary fittings one only understands\n\nsuch pipes or materials as are used in lavatories, urinals\n\nor bath rooms of private houses or public buildings. In\n\nthe present case there was absolutely no material before the\n\nSales Tax Officer to show that any of the hume pipes manu-\n\nfactured and sold by the respondent were meant for use in\n\nlavatories. urinals or bath rooms and. in fact. the material\n\nwas used entirely the other way. the Sales Tax Officer was\n\nnot at all justified in holding that they were sanitary\n\nfittings [123 F- H]\n\n     (3) The Sales Tax Officer does not appear to have ap-\n\nplied his mind at all to the reasons as to how and why hume\n\npipes could be treated as sanitary fittings. The re-\n\nspondent had filed an application before the Sales\n\nTax Officer wherein he had clearly alleged substantial facts\n\nshowing that the hume pipes could never be used as sanitary\n\nfittings; that it is only the G.I.P. Pipes or other kinds of\n\npipes which are used in lavatories, urinals and bath rooms\n\nwhich could be termed as sanitary fittings. The respondent\n\nhad placed a large catena of materials in the shape of\n\ncertificates from technical experts, engineers and highly\n\nreputed dealers in sanitary fittings that hume pipes are\n\nnever used as sanitary fittings. Even where a hume pipe is\n\nused for carrying the escrated material from the Commode to\n\nthe Sceptic tank that may be treated as sanitary fittings. The appellant in his counter affidavit before the High Court\n\ndid not controvert any of the facts mentioned by the re-\n\nspondent, The State produced no material to controvert the\n\nfacts. [122 D-G--123A]\n\n     (4) The Court observed that if at any time the material\n\n\nproduced before the Sales Tax Authorities establishes that\nin a given case hume pipes were meant to be used in the\nbath rooms, urinals and lavatories etc., then the notifica-\ntion of the Government would be attracted. [124 A-B ]\n\nJUDGMENT: \n CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 784 of 1972. \n (From the Judgment and Order dated 29-9-1970 of the  Allaha- bad High Court in Civil Misc. Writ No. 1111/70).\n S.C. Manchanda and O.P. Rana, for the appellants.\n S.V. Gupte, S.V. Vaidya, K. Rajendra Chaudhary and Mrs.\n Veena Devi Khanna, for the respondent. \n The Judgment of the Court. was delivered by FAZAL ALI, J. This appeal by certificate raises a short question of law as to whether or not hume pipes which are the subject-matter of the. present case amount to \"sanitary fittings\" as contemplated by a notification issued by the Government under the U.P. Sales Tax Act. The respondent is a dealer engaged in the manufacture and supply of hume pipes. \n The pipes manufactured by the respondent are reinforced with cement concrete pipes and the respondent also manufactures high quality and high pressure pipes like prestressed concrete pipes for water supply, R.C.C. pressure pipes, penstock pipes used in hydroelectric projects etc. The respondent was a supplier of pipes to various Governmental Departments both Central and State, such as Irrigation, Public Works, Local Self Government Engineering, Railways and Ministry of Petroleum etc. It appears that a dispute arose between the respondent and the Sales Tax Department with respect to the rate of tax for sale a-pipes manufactured by the respondent for the assessment years 1962-63, 1963-64 and 1964-65, According to the notification issued by. the Government in pursuance of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, items classed as \"sanitary fittings\" were to be taxed at 7% instead of 2 %. \n The Sales Tax Officer treated the hume pipes supplied by the respondent as \"sanitary fittings\" and imposed sales tax at the rate of 7 %. Instead of going in appeal to the Assist- ant Commissioner (Judicial) the respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court assailing the order of the Sales Tax Officer on the ground that the hume pipes manufactured by the assessee could not, by any stretch of imagination, be construed to be \"sanitary fittings\", nor were they ever used as such. The High Court, after hearing counsel for the parties and after perusing the materials on the record, accepted the plea of the respondent and held that the hume pipes could not be treated as \"sanitary fittings\" and the Sales Tax Officer was., therefore, not entitled to levy tax at the rate of 7%. The High Court accordingly quashed the assessments made by the Sales Tax Officer and hence this appeal by the Department after obtaining a certificate. from the High Court. \n In our opinion, the facts of this appeal lie within a very narrow compass. The only point which arises for. \n consideration is whether or not the hume pipes manufactured by the respondent could be said to be \"sanitary fittings\".\n  The notification dated September 1, 1966 amended the existing entry as \"sanitary goods and fittings\" but in these assessment years-we are concerned with the entry as it stood unamended. The Sales Tax Officer does not appear to have applied his mind at all to the reasons as to how and why hume pipes could be treated as sanitary fittings.. \n Apart from his ipsi dixit that hume pipes amounted to sani- tary fittings, he based his order on no other material. The respondent had filed an application before the Sales Tax Officer wherein he had clearly alleged substantial facts showing that the hume pipes could never be used as \"sanitary fittings\"; It is only the G.I. pipes or other kinds of pipes which are used in lavatories, urinals and bath-rooms which can be termed as 'sanitary fittings\". Neither the con- tract nor the tender by the respondent show the exact use for which the hume pipes were meant. On the other hand the respondent had produced a large catena of materials in the shape of certificates from technical experts, Engineers and highly reputed dealers in sanitary fittings to show that hume pipes are never used as sanitary fittings. In spite of these materials, the State, when it filed its counter-affi- davit before the High Court, did not controvert any of the facts mentioned by the respondent, vide paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the counter-affidavit filed before the High Court. The materials consist of certificates by Local Self Government Engineering Department, U.P., to show that the pipes sup- plied by the respondent were not used as \"sanitary fit- tings\". This certificate appears at p. 34 of the Paper Book and shows that R.C.C.Pipes purchased from the respondent had not been used as sanitary fittings by the L.S.G.E. Depart- ment. This certificate is signed by the Executive Engi- neer: on behalf of the Chief Engineer of the Department. \nFrom pp. 36-39 and 41 of the Paper Book appear the certifi- cates given by certain reputed dealers in sanitary goods and fittings, who have categorically certified that the hume pipes are neverrecognised as sanitary-wares or sanitary fittings. As against this, the State produced no materials to controvert these facts, which could not be brushed aside. At p. 40 there is a certificate by the Ex. Special Engineer, Bombay Municipal Corporation and Ex. Director, Central Public Health Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur, in which he has clearly observed that sanitary-wares and sanitary fit- tings are applicable to fittings used in the household for W.Cs. wash-basins, traps, sinks etc. and, therefore, hume and R.C.C. pipes cannot be recognised as sanitary-wares or, sanitary fittings. As against this, the State produced no material to controvert these facts. \n It is well settled that when we are dealing with the articles used for business purposes, the terms must be interpreted in a purely commercial sense. In Ramavatar Budhaiprasad etc. v. Assistant Sales Tax Officer, Akola(1) this Court, while construing the import of the word \"vegeta- bles\", observed as follows: \"But this word must be construed not in any technical sense nor from the botanical point of view but as understood in common parlance. It has not been defined in the Act and being a word of every day use it must be construed in its popular sense meaning \"that sense which people conversant with the subject matter with which the statute is dealing would attribute to it.\" It is to be construed as understood in common language;\"\nTo the same effect is a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada in The King. v. Planters Nut and Chocolate Company Limited(2) where the Court observed as follows: \"The words \"fruit\" and \"vegetable\" are not defined in the Act and so far as 'I am aware they are not defined in any other Act in pari material. They are ordinary words in every-day use and are therefore to be con- strued according to their popular sense\".\n        In these circumstances, therefore, we have to construe the expression \"sanitary fittings\" in the popular sense of the term as it is used in our every-day life. Thus constru- ing, it would be manifest that there could be no question of use of R.C.C. or hume pipes which are generally laid underground and are extremely heavy. for the purpose of use in lavatories, urinals or bath-rooms etc. By \"sanitary fittings\" we only understand such pipes or materials as are used in lavatories, urinals or bath-rooms of private houses or public buildings. Even where a hume pipe is used for carrying, the secreted material from the commode to the septic tank that may be treated as sanitary fittings. In the instant case as there was. absolutely no material before the Sales Tax Officer to show that any of the hume pipes manufactured and sold by the respondent were meant for use in lavatories, urinals or bath-rooms and in fact the materi- al was used entirely the other way, the Sales Tax Officer was not at all justified in holding that they were sanitary fittings. \n       (1) [1962] 1 S.C.R. 279, 282.\n       (2) (1951) Canada L.R. Ex. Court 122 126Of course, we must make it clear that if at any time the material produced before the Sales Tax authorities estab- lishes that in a given case the hume pipes were meant for use in a bathroom, lavatory, urinal etc.. then the. notifi- cation of the Government would attracted and the assessee must be liable to be taxed at the rate of 7%. \n       Lastly, it was feebly argued by Mr. Manchanda that the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition and should have allowed the assessee to avail of the reme- dies provided to him under the U.P. Sales. Tax Act, particu- larly when questions of fact had to be determined. In the instant case, the question as to what is the true connota- tion of the words \"sanitary fittings\" and whether the hume pipes manufactured and sold by the respondent were sanitary fittings within the meaning of that expression was a ques- tion of law and since the entire material on the basis of which this question could be determined was placed before the Sales Tax Officer and it pointed in one and only one direction, namely, that the hume pipes were not sanitary fittings and there Was nothing to show otherwise, the High Court was justified in entertaining the writ petition. \nMoreover, there is no rule of law that the High Court should not entertain. a writ petition where an alternative remedy is available to a party. It is always a matter of discretion with the Court and if the discretion has been exercised by the High Court not unreasonably, or perversely, it is the settled practice of this Court not to interfere with the exercise of discretion by the nigh Court. The High Court in the present case entertained the writ petition and decid- ed the question of law arising in it and in our opinion rightly. In these circumstances, therefore, we would not be justified in the interest of justice in interfering in our jurisdiction under Art. 136 of the Constitution to quash the order of the High Court merely on this ground after having found that the order is legally correct. We are, therefore, unable to accept this contention. For these reasons. therefore, we find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court and affirm the same. The result is that the appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed with costs. \n Appeal dismissed. \n              P.H.P.",

The\ncompany entered into a contract with the Textile\nCommissioner undertaking to dye a large quantity of cloth\nwhich was supplied to the company for that purpose. In\npursuance of the contract certain quantity of cloth was dyed\nand delivered to the Textile Commissioner by the company but\nit failed to dye and deliver the balance of cloth which\nremained in its possession and was not returned to the\nTextile Commissioner in spite of repeated demands. \nUltimately the two appellants were prosecuted for criminal\nbreach of trust under S. 409 read with S. 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code and were convicted for the same in a trial by\njury. In appeal the High Court reviewed the evidence on the ground\nof misdirection to the jury but found that the two\nappellants were liable to account for the cloth over which\nthey had dominion, and having failed to do so each of them\nwas guilty of the offence of criminal breach of trust. The\nHigh Court refused to accept the appellants' plea that the\ncloth was old and was eaten up by white ants and moths. On\nappeal by the appellants by special leave:\nHeld, that to establish a charge of criminal breach of\ntrust, the prosecution was not bound to prove the precise\nmode of conversion, misappropriation or misapplication by\nthe accused of the property entrusted to him or over which\n\nhe had dominion. The principal ingredient of the offence of\ncriminal breach of trust being dishonest misappropriation\nthe mere failure of the accused to account for the property\nentrusted to him might not be the foundation of his\nconviction in all cases but where he was unable to account\nand rendered an explanation for his failure which was\nuntrue, an inference of misappropriation with dishonest\nintent might readily be made. \nThe essence of liability under S. 34 of the Indian Penal\nCode is the existence of a common intention animating the\noffenders and the participation in a criminal act in\nfurtherance of the common intention. The physical presence\nat the scene of offence of the offender sought to be\nrendered liable under S. 34 is not, on the words of the\nstatute, one of the conditions of its applicability in every\ncase. \nBarendra Kumar Ghose v.

March 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH, J.--At a trial held with the aid of a common jury in Case No. 38 of the Vth Session 1955 before theAdditional Sessions Judge, City Court, Greater Bombay , the two appellants were convicted of offences under s. 409 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The Additional Sessions Judge sentenced the first appellant to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five years and the second appellant to suffer rigorous imprisonment for four years. \nIn appeal, the High Court of Bombay reviewed the evidence, because in the view of the Court, the verdict of the jury was vitiated on account of a misdirection on a matter of substantial importance, but held that the conviction of the two appellants for the offence under s. 409 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code was, on the evidence, not liable to be set aside. The High Court accordingly confirmed the conviction of the two appellants but reduced the sentence passed upon the first appellant to rigorous imprisonment for three years and the sentence against the second appellant to rigorous imprisonment for one year. Against the order of conviction and sentence, the appellants have appealed to this court with special leave. \nThe facts which gave rise to the charge against the two appellants are briefly these: On June 15, 1948, the Textile Commissioner invited tenders for dyeing Pugree Cloth. The Parikh Dyeing and Printing Mills Ltd., Bombay-hereinafter to be referred to as the company-of which the first appellant was the Managing Director and the second appellant was a Director and technical expert, submitted a tender which was accepted on July 27, 1948, subject to certain general and special conditions. Pursuant to the contract, 2,51,059-3/4 yards of cloth were supplied to the company for dyeing. The company failed to dye the cloth within the stipulated period and there was correspondence in that behalf between the company and the Textile Commissioner. Approximately 1,11,000. yards out of the cloth were dyed and delivered to the Textile Commissioner. On March 25, 1950, the company requested the Textile Commissioner to cancel the contract and by his letter dated April 3, 1950, the Textile Commissioner complied with the request, and cancelled the contract in respect of 96,128 yards. On November 20, 1950, the contract was cancelled by theTextile Commissioner in respect of the balance of cloth and the company was called upon to give an account without any further delay of the balance undelivered and it was informed that it would be held responsible for \" material spoiled or not accounted for \". On December 4, 1950, the company sent a statement of account setting out the quantity of cloth actually delivered for dyeing, the quantity of cloth returned duly dyed and the balance of cloth, viz., 1,32,160 yards remaining to be delivered. Against the cloth admitted by the company remaining to be delivered, it claimed a wastage allowance of 2,412 yards and admitted liability to deliver 1,29,748 yards lying with it on Government account. \nIt appears that about this time, the company was in financial difficulties. In December 1950, the first appellant left Bombay to take up the management of a factory in Ahmedabad and the affairs of the company were managed by one R. K. Patel. In June 1952, an application for adjudicating the two appellants insolvents was filed in the Insolvency Court at Ahmedabad. An insolvency notice was also taken out against the two appellants at the instance of another creditor in the High Court at Bombay. Proceedings for winding up the company were commenced in the High Court at Bombay. In the meantime, the mortgagee of the machinery and factory of the company had entered into possession under a covenant reserved in that behalf, of the premises of the factory of the company. The Textile Commissioner made attempts to recover the cloth remaining undelivered by the company. A letter was posted by the Textile Commissioner on April 16, 1952, calling upon the company to deliver 51,756 yards of cloth lying with it in bleached condition to the Chief Ordnance Officer, Ordnance Depot,, Sewri, but the letter was returned undelivered. It was ultimately served with the help of the police on the second appellant in October 1952. Thereafter on November 7, 1952, another letter was addressed to the company and the same was served on the second appellant on November 25, 1952. By this letter, the company was reminded that 1,35,726-3/4 yards of clothwere lying with it on account of the government and the same had to be accounted for, and that the instructions to deliver 51,756 yards to the Chief Ordnance Officer, Ordnance Depot, Sewri, had not been attended to. The Textile Commissioner called upon the company to send its representatives to \" clarify the position \" and to account for the material. After receiving this letter, the second appellant attended at the office of the' Textile Commissioner and on November 27, 1952, wrote a letter stating that \" the main factors involved in not delivering the goods in finished state was that the material was very old \", was \" dhobibleached in different lots\", was \"\nbleached under different conditions and therefore unsuitable for vat colour dyeing in heavy shades\", that it varied in length, weight, and finish and had \" lost affinity for vat colour dyeing\". It was also stated that the company had in dyeing the basic material, suffered \" huge losses\" estimated at Rs. 40,000. It was then stated: \" We are, therefore, however prepared to co-operate with the Government and are willing to make good the government's bare cost. Please let us know the detail and the actual amount to be deposited so that we may do so at, an early date. We shall thank you if we are given an appointment to discuss the matter as regards the final amount with respect to the balance quantity of the basic material.\" On December 29, 1952, the premises of the company and the place of residence of the appellants were raided, but no trace of the cloth was found. A complaint was then filed with the police charging the two appellants with criminal breach of trust. in respect of 1,32,4041 yards of cloth belonging to the Government. \nThere is no dispute that approximately 1,30,000 yards out of the cloth -entrusted to the company by the Textile Commissioner for dyeing has not been returned. By its letter dated December 4, 1950, the company admitted liability to deliver 1,29,748 yards of cloth, but this cloth has not been returned to the Textile Commissioner in spite of repeated demands. That the appellants, as directors of the company had dominion over that cloth was not questioned in, the trial court. The plea that there were other Directorsof the company besides the appellants who had dominion over the cloth has been negatived by the High Court and in our judgment rightly. Direct evidence to establish misappropriation of the cloth over which the appellants had dominion is undoubtedly lacking, but to establish a charge of criminal breach of trust, the prosecution is not obliged to prove the precise mode of conversion, misappropriation or misapplication by the accused of the property entrusted to him or over which he has dominion. The principal ingredient of the offence being dishonest misappropriation or conversion which may not ordinarily be a matter of direct proof, entrustment of property and failure in breach of an obligation to account for the property entrusted, if proved, may in the light of other circumstances, justifiably lead to -an inference of dishonest misappropriation or conversion. \nConviction of a person for the offence of criminal breach of trust may not, in all cases, be founded merely on his failure to account for the property entrusted to him, or over which he has dominion, even when a duty to account is imposed upon him, but where he is unable to account or renders an explanation for his failure to account which is untrue, an inference of misappropriation with dishonest intent may readily be made. \nIn this case, on a search of the factory on December 29, 1952, the cloth remaining to be delivered by the company was not found. At the trial, the appellants sought to explain the disappearance of the cloth from the factory premises where it was stored, on the plea that it was old and was eaten up by white-ants and moths, and had been thrown away as rubbish. This plea of the appellants was not accepted by the High Court and we think rightly. No information was given at any time to the Textile Commissioner after December 4, 1950, that the cloth had been eaten up by white-ants and moths, and was therefore thrown away or otherwise destroyed. \nNor was any evidence led in support of the plea by the appellants. \nIn this court, counsel for the first appellant contended that failure to return the cloth may give rise to a civil liability to make good the loss occasionedthereby, but in the circumstances of the case, the first appellant cannot be found guilty of the offence of criminal breach of trust. Counsel submitted that the first appellant had left Bombay in 1950 and had settled down in Ahmedabad and was attending to a factory in that town, that thereafter the first appellant was involved in insolvency proceedings and was unable to attend to the affairs of the company in Bombay, and if, on account of the pre-occupation of the first appellant at Ahmedabad, he was unable to visit Bombay and the goods were lost, no criminal misappropriation can be attributed to him. But the case pleaded by the appellant negatives this submission. The first appellant in his statement before the trial court admitted that he often went to Bombay even after he had migrated to Ahmedabad and-that he visited the mill premises and got the same opened by the Gurkha watchman and he found that the heap of cloth lying in the mill was getting smaller every time he visited the mill and on inquiry, he was told by the watchman that every day one basketful of sweepings was thrown away. He also stated that he was shown several places in the compound of the factory where pits had been filled up with these sweepings, and that he found a small heap lying by the side of the \"\nTulsipipe gutter\" and also in the warehouses in the mill premises. It is clear from this statement and other evidence on the record that even after he migrated to Ahmedabad, the first appellant was frequently visiting the factory at Bombay. The evidence also discloses that meetings of Directors were held from time to time, but the minutes of the Directors' meetings have not been produced. \nThe books of account-of the company evidencing disbursements to the Directors of remuneration for attending the meetings and the expenses for the alleged collection and throwing away of the sweepings have not been produced. It is admitted by the first appellant that the letter dated November 27, 1952, was written by the second appellant under his instructions. In his statement at the trial, the first appellant stated that he was informed of the letter dated November 26, 1952, from the Textile Commissioner and that he326 could not attend the office of that officer because he was busy attending to the insolvency proceedings and that he deputed the second appellant to attend the office and to explain and discuss the position. Be then stated, \"We had informed the Commissioner that the company was prepared to pay for the cloth remaining after deducting the amount claimed as damages\". The letter dated November 27, 1952, was evidently written under the direction of the first appellant and by that letter, liability to pay for the cloth after certain adjustments for losses alleged to be suffered by the company in carrying out the contract was admitted.\n By the letter dated December 4, 1950, liability to deliver the cloth was admitted and by the letter dated November 27, 1952, liability to pay compensation for the loss occasioned to the Government was affirmed. The appellants who were liable to account for the cloth over which they had dominion have failed to do so, and they have rendered a false explanation for their failure to account. The High Court was of the opinion that this false defence viewed in the light of failure to produce the books of account, the stock register and the complete absence of reference in the correspondence with the Textile Commissioner about the cause of disappearance established misappropriation with criminal intent. \n Counsel for the first appellant contended that probably the goods passed into the possession of the mortgagees of the assets of the company. but on this part of the submission, no evidence was led in the trial court. Counsel for the first appellant, relying upon the observations in Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. The State of Bombay (1), also contended that, in any event, a charge under s. 409 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code cannot be established against the first appellant unless it is shown that at the time of misappropriation of the goods, the first appellant was physically present . But the essence of liability under s.34 is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the offenders leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of the (1) [1955] 1 S.C R. 1177.common intention and presence of the offender sought to be rendered liable under s. 34 is not, on the words of the statute, one of the conditions of its applicability. As explained by Lord Sumner in Barendra Kumar Ghose v. The King Emperor(') the leading feature of s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code is 'participation' in action. To establish joint responsibility for an offence, it must of course be established that a criminal act was done by several persons; the participation must be in doing the act, not merely in its planning. A common intention--a meeting of minds--to commit an offence and participation in the commission of the offence in furtherance of that common intention invite the application of s. 34. But this participation need not in all cases be by physical presence. In offences involving physical violence, normally presence at the scene of offence of the offenders sought to be rendered liable on the principle of joint liability may be necessary, but such is not the case in respect of other offences where the offence consists of diverse acts which may be done at different times and places. In Shree Kantiah's case (supra), misappropriation was committed by removing goods from a Government depot and on the occasion of the removal of the goods, the first accused was not present. It was therefore doubtful whether he had participated in the commission of the offence, and this court in those circumstances held that participation by the first accused was not established. The observations in Shree Kantiah's case (supra) in so far as they deal with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code must, in our judgment, be read in the light of the facts established and are not intended to lay down a principle of universal application. \nThe High Court has found that the two appellants were liable to account for the cloth over which they had dominion and.\nthey failed to account for the same and therefore each had committed the offence of criminal breach of trust. The High Court observed: \" In such a case, if accused Nos. 1 and 2 (Appellants 1 & 2) alone were concerned with the receipt of the goods, if they were dealing with the goods all the time, if they were receiving communications from the Textile Commissioner's office and sending replies, to (1) [1924] L.R. 52 I.A. 40, 52.them, and if the part played by each of them is apparent from the manner in which they are shown to have dealt with this contract, then it is a case of two persons entrusted with the goods and a breach of trust obviously being committed by both of them'.\n It was submitted that the High Court erred in finding the appellants guilty of offences under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code when the charge framed against them was one under s. 409 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code. A charge framed against the accused person, referring to s. 34 is but a convenient form of giving notice to him that the principle of joint liability is sought to be invoked. Section 34 does not create an offence; it merely enunciates a principle of joint liability for criminal acts done in furtherance of the common intention of the offenders. Conviction of an accused person recorded, relying upon the principle of joint liability, is therefore for the offence committed in furtherance of the common intention and if the reasons for conviction establish that the accused was convicted for an offence committed in furtherance of the common intention of himself and others, a reference in the order recording conviction to s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code may appear to be asurplusage. The order of the High Court recording the conviction of the appellants for the offence under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code is therefore not illegal. \nIt was submitted for the first appellant that the sentence passed against him was unduly severe, and that, in any event, no distinction should have been made between him and the second appellant in the matter of sentence. It is evident on the findings accepted by us that property of considerable value has been misappropriated by the first appellant. He was the Managing Director of the company an& primarily, he had dominion over the property entrusted to the company. The second appellant was, though a Director, essentially a technician. Having regard to these circumstances, if the High Court has made a distinction between the two appellants, we ought not to interfere with the sentence, which by itself cannot be said to be excessive. \nThe appeal fails and is dismissed. \n Appeal dismissed.",

During the relevant\nassessment year sale of matches was taxable under s. 5(3)(a)\nof the Mysore Sales Tax Act, 1957 on the first or earliest\nof the successive dealers in the State of Mysore. The modus\noperandi of the appellant in purchasing these matches was\nthat it placed orders with the sales depots of the\nmanufacturers inside Mysore. The Managers of the depots\nforwarded the orders to the principles who has their head\noffice at Sivakasi outside the State of Mysore. The matches\nwere thereafter despatched by the principal to the appellant\nin accordance with the instructions received from the Sales\nDepots. The Sales Depots sent the appellant detailed in-\nvoices of the matches despatched by their factories. The\nappellant gave credit to the value of the matches after\ndeducting therefrom the amount covered by debit notes in\nrespect of Octroi, lorry freight and other incidental\ncharges incurred by it and at the request of the sales\noffice the appellant remitted the value of the matches\ndirect to the factory by means of draft and telegraphic\ntransfer. The appellant's contention was that it purchased\nthe matches from the sales depots inside Mysore State who\nwere the first sellers of the matches in the State of Mysore\nliable to tax and the appellant being the second dealer in\nthe State was not liable to tax in respect of its sales. The assessing authority came to the conclusion that the\ntransactions were inter-State sales within the meaning of s.\n3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act and since the appellant\nwas the first dealer in matches in Mysore State it was\nliable to pay sales tax. The appellant's appeals to the\nDeputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, and to the Tribunal\nwere unsuccessful. The High Court rejected the revision\n\npetition filed by the appellant. In appeal to this Court,\nHELD : From the facts the sales were made by the respective\nfactories direct to the appellant. The sales price was also\nsent directly to the. factories at Sivakasi. No doubt the\norders were routed through the sales depot but on that\naccount it could not be said that the factory sold the goods\nordered by the appellant to its sales depot. It was\ninconceivable that there could be a sale between the\nmanufacturer and its Sales Depot. [215 E- G]\nThe transactions in question under explanation 3(a) to s.\n2(t) of the Mysore Act were the first sales in favour of the\nappellant and they took place in the State of Mysore. The\ndecision in the case of Ram Narain & Sons, if applied to the\nfacts of the present case, would indicate that the first\nsale by the Sivakasi firms was in Mysore. In that view, the\nquestion of inter State sale not being urged as necessary\nfor consideration, it was rightly held by the High Court\nthat the sales in question fell within cl. (a) of\nExplanation 3 of s. 2(t) of the Act. As Such the appeal\nmust be dismissed. [216 E, 217 D-E]Ram Narain & Sons v. Asstt. Commissioner of Sales tax &\nOrs., [1955] 2 S.C.R. 483, discussed. \n\nJUDGMENT: \nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 1175 of 1967. \nAppeal from the judgment and order dated September 30, 1966 of the Mysore High Court in S.T.R.P. No. 58 of 1965. \nR. Gopalakrishnan, for the appellant. \nA. R. Somanatha Iyer, M. S. Narasimhan and R. B. Datar, for -..the respondent. \nThe Judgment of the Court was, delivered by P. Jaganmohan Reddy, J. This Appeal is by certificate against the judgment of the Mysore High Court dismissing the Revision Petition against the order of the Mysore Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, by and under which the assessment order of the Commercial Tax Officer and the Appellate order of the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Tax was confirmed. The question of law which arose out of the decision of the Sales Tax authorities for consideration of the High Court was\"\nwhether on the facts and circumstances of the case the assessee's- turn-over in respect of safety matches is not liable to tax on the ground ,that the sales effected by the assessee are not the first sales in the State.\" The appellants declared for the assessment year 1959-60 a total turn-over of Rs. 13,04,097/- in respect of the purchase of safety matches and claimed exemption on the entire turnover on the ground that it was a subsequent sale from the ,dealers in the State of Mysore. During the relevant assessment year sale of matches was taxable under sec. 5 (3 ) (a) of the Mysore Sales Tax Act, 1957 (hereinafter called the Act)on the first or earliest of the successive dealers in the State of Mysore. The appellants contention was that it purchases the matches from the Sales Depots of the National Match Works, Lakshmi Match Works and Palaniappa Match Industries at Devangere who were the first sellers of matches in the State of Mysore liable to tax and that the appellant was the second dealer in the State not liable to tax in respect of its sales. The Modus operandi of the appellant in purchasing these matches was that it placed orders with the aforesaid Sales Depots of M/s. National Match Works, Lakshmi Match Works and Palaniappa Match Industries at Devangers, which Depots are registered dealers under the Act. On receipt of these orders from the Appellant the respective Managers of the three Sales Depots forward the orders to their Head Offices at Sivakasi and instruct them to despatch the matches ordered direct to the appellant at Devangere. The matches are thereafter despatched by lorry to the Appellant in accordance with the instructions received from the Sales Depots. The Sales Depots send to the appellant detailed invoices of the matches despatched by their factories The Appellant gives credit to the value of the matches after deducting therefrom the amount covered by debit notes in respect of Octroi, lorry freight and other incidental charges incurred by it and at the request of the sales office the assessee remits the value of the matches direct to the factory by means of draft and telegraphic transfer. On these findings the correctness of which was not disputed the assessing authority came to the conclusion that the transactions were inter-State sales within the meaning of 'Sec. 3 (a) of the Central Sales Tax Act and since the appellant was the first dealer in matches in Mysore State it was liable to pay Sales Tax and accordingly, it was so assessed. Against the said assessment order the appellant filed an appeal to the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes who dismissed the appeal. The further appeal to the Tribunal was equally unsuccessful. \nBefore us it is contended by the learned Advocate for the appellant relying upon the despatch advice, delivery notes and invoices issued in the name of the assessee in which the Sales Tax @ 2% was charged that the sale by the manufacturer at Sivakasi was effected in favour of their respective sales Depots in Mysore and it is only thereafter that the appellants purchased from these Sales Depots the matches and cannot therefore be treated as the first purchaser in the Mysore State. It appears to us on the facts as set out above which were not in dispute, the sales were made by the respective factories direct to the appellant, the sales price was also sent directly to the factories at Sivakasi. \nNo doubt the orders were routed through the Sales Depot but on that account it cannot be said that the factory sold the goods ordered by the appellant to its Sales Depot. It does not appear that the content-ion based on the invoices showing that the Sales Tax was charged by the Sales Depot was urged before any of the authorities or before the High Court nor was there any finding on this aspect as is evident from the facts found by the Sales Tax authorities which were not in dispute. It is also inconceivable that there can be a sale between the manufacturer and its Sales Depot. \nIt is not disputed that under the provisions of the Act it is the first sale in the State that is exigible to tax. \nSale is defined in sec. 2(t) of the Act as follows: - \"Sale' with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions means every transfer of the property in goods by one person to another in the course of tradeor business for cash or for deferred payments or other valuable consideration, but does not include a mortgage hypothecation, charge or pledge\".\nExplanation (3) to this definition which is relevant is given below:- (a) The sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed for the purpose of this Act, to have taken place in the State wherever the contract of sale or purchase might have been made, if the goods are within the State (I) In the case of specific or ascertained goods, at the time the contract or sale or purchase is made; and (II) in the case of unascertained or future goods, at the time of their appropriation to the contract of sale or purchase by the seller or by the purchaser, whether the assent of the other party is prior or subsequent to such appropriation\". \nIt is apparent from the above provisions that the transactions in question under explanation 3(a) are the first sales in favour of the appellant and they took place within the State of Mysore. The learned advocate relies on the decision in Ram Narain & Sons v. The Assistant Commissioner of Sales-Tax & Others(1), for the contention that in similar circumstances the sale was said to have been affected to the depots and consequently the sale to the assessee was the second sale and is, therefore, not assessable to tax. The High Court, before which this decision was cited, did not rely upon it because it felt that it was not possible to ascertain whether under the statute this Court was called upon to consider the definition of sale similar to that contained in section 2 (t) of the Act. It is true that in that case while this Court was considering the question whether the sales were inter-State sales or inside sales, the definition of 'sale' under the Madhya Pradesh Sales Tax Act was not specifically referred to or examined. A perusal of that decision, however, would show that what this Court was considering was whether the transactions fell within the definition of sale contained in explanation 11 to section 2(g) of the Madhya Pradesh Sales Tax Act and that so far as the post-Cons- titution period was concerned, whether they were saved from the ban of Article 286(1) (a) and the explanation thereto, by the President's order made under the proviso to Article 286(2). The Advocate General of Madhya Pradesh, no doubt, urged that the (1) [1955] (2) S.C.R. 483.transactions were pure inside sales entered into by the assessees in Madhya Pradesh on orders received by them from outside the State, and accepted by the petitioners in that State. It was also contended that the goods were appropriated to the contracts, and the property in the goods passed within the State of Madhya Pradesh, as such the sales were inter-State sales or inside sales which, it was within the competence of the State of Madhya Pradesh to tax. The facts disclosed that the assessees manufactured beedis in Madhya Pradesh. They had various sales depots in U.P. and other State and also had selling agents through whom they sold their goods. Apart from affecting sales through the said agencies. they also sold direct to customers who placed orders with them. The question was whether some or all of those sales took place in Madhya Pradesh or in U.P. and it was held that having regard to the transactions in respect of all the aforesaid categories of sales, they were affected in U.P. We are unable to appreciate how this case really assists the appellants. On the other hand, it would appear that the sale by the assessee was affected in U.P., which if applied to the facts in this case, would indicate that the first sale by the Sivakasi firms was in Mysore. In that view, the question of inter-State sale not being urged as necessary for consideration, it was rightly held by the High Court that the sales in question fell within clause (a) of explanation (3) of section 2(t) of the Act; as such this appeal is dismissed but in the circumstances, without costs. \n G.

The respondent was a\nmember of such a scheduled tribe residing in such an area,\nbut, as he was a government servant, he was assessed to\nincome-tax. He challenged the validity of the assessments\nand the High Court quashed the assessments holding that the\ntwo sections. to the extent they excluded government\nservants from the benefit of the exemption given thereunder,\nwere discriminatory and therefore void.\n In appeal to this Court. \n\n       HELD: The State has a wide discretion in selecting\npersons or objects it will tax, but within the range of\nselection made by it for the purpose of exemption, namely,\namong members of certain scheduled tribes residing in\nspecified areas, the law as stated in the two sections. operates unequally and the inequality cannot be justified on\nthe basis of any valid classification. [168H; 169B-C]\n\n       (1) The classification of trials into government\nservants and others cannot be justified on the basis of\nadministrative convenience viz.. that it was easy to collect\ntaxes from government servants, because. their case does\nnot stand on a different footing from that of the employees\nin statutory corporations or well-established firms. [169F-\nG]\n\n       (2) There is no legislative practice or history treating\ngovernment servants as a separate class for purposes of\nincome tax. The reason for making, in the past, persons in\nthe service of the government of British India serving\noutside British India subject to Indian income-tax. is not\nt, hat their income was treated in a manner different from\nthat of other salaried officers in those areas, but that the\nIndian Legislature had no legislative competence to tax\nresidents of those areas but had competence to tax the\nincome of persons in British Indian government service,\nserving in those areas. Further, the notification of 6th\nJune 1890 under which the income earned by members of\ncertain scheduled tribes, other than those in government\nservice, was exempt from income tax, and the notification of\n21st March 1922. under which income of certain indigenous\nhill men, other than those in government service. was exempt\nfrom tax, are not sufficient to prove a well-established\nlegislative practice. Those notifications were issued at a\ntime when the power of the legislature to grant or withhold\nany exemption from tax was not subject to any\nconstitutional limitation. Classification based on past\nlegislativepractice and history does not mean that because in the past\nthe legislature was enacting arbitrary laws it could do so\nnow. [170A; 171D-F]\n(3) The social status and economic resources of a government\nservant are not different from that of another holding a\nsimilar position in a corporation or that of a successful\nmedical practitioner, lawyer, architect etc. Therefore,\nmerely because a tribal becomes a government servant he is\nnot lifted out of his social environment and assimilated\ninto the forward sections of society. [172A-B]\n\n       (4) The portions of the two sections struck down are\nseverable from the rest of the provisions in which they\n appear . [172E-F]\n\nJUDGMENT: \n       CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 809 of 1966. \n       Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated February 13, 1965 of the Assam and Nagaland High Court in Civil Rule No. 127 of 1963. \n Niren De, Solicitor-General, A.N. Kirpal, S.P. Netyar for R.N. Sachthey for the appellants. \nM.C. Setalvad and D.N. Mukherjee, for the respondent. \n D.M. Sen, Advocate-General for the State of Nagaland, A.R. Barthakur and R. Gopalakrishnan, for the intervener. \nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hegde, J. The only question that arises for decision in this appeal is whether the exclusion of the government servants from the exemption given under s. 4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and later on under s. 10(26) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. For our present purpose it may be taken that the said two provisions are similar. The respondent who is a government servant serving in the State of Assam has been assessed to income tax for the assessment years 1959-60, 1960-61, 1961-62 and 1962-63. He challenged the legality of his assessments in civil rule No.\n127 of 1963 on the file of the High Court of Judicature of Assam. The Assam High Court accepted his petition and quashed the assessments in question holding that s.\n 4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income tax Act. 1922 as well as s.\n10(26) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to the extent they excluded government servants from the benefit of the exemption given thereunder are void. The income-tax authorities as well as the Union of India have come up to this Court in appeal by special leave. \n The facts of this case lie within a narrow compass. The respondent belongs to Mikir Scheduled Tribe and is a permanent inhabitant of United Khasi-Jaintia Hills District, an autonomous, District included in Part 'A' of the Table appended to Paragraph20 of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India. He is a government servant. All these are admitted facts. \n The respondent in his petition before the High Court averred (in para. 7 of the petition) that \"in all the autonomous districts under Table, Part A of paragraph 26 of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India, there are a large number of persons belonging to Scheduled Tribe who derive considerable income from trade, commerce and business and other sources and employments and immovable properties\". \nIn the return filed by the appellants those allegations were not denied. Adverting to those allegations this is what was stated in the affidavit filed by Shri S.K. Dutta, Income-tax Officer (the first appellant in the appeal): \"With reference to the statements made in paragraph 7 of the petition I say that the petitioner being a government servant his case stands on a different footing other than the general public of the Scheduled Tribe.\"\n  It may be remembered till 15-8-47, Khasi and Jaintia Hills were not parts of British India. They were under native States. They merged with British India only after this country got independence. Till their merger, none of the Indian laws applied to those areas. The Finance Act of 1955 incorporated into the Indian Income Tax Act,1922, s.4(3) (xxi). The relevant portion of s. 4(3) reads thus: 4(3). \"Any income profits, or gains falling within the following classes shall not be included in the total income of the person receiving them.\"\n                         (xxi). \"Any income of a member of a Scheduled Tribe, as defined in clause (25) of Article 366 of the Constitution, residing in any area specified in Part`A or Part B of the table appended to paragraph 20 of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution, provided that such member is not in the service of Government.\"\n                         Sec. 10(26) of the income tax Act of 1961 which corresponds to S. 4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, reads thus :- \"In the case of a member of a Scheduled Tribe as defined in clause (25) of Article 366 of the Constitution, residing in any area 'specified in Part A or Part B of the Table appended to paragraph 20 of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution or in the Union Territories of Manipur and Tripura, who is not in the service of Government. any income which accrues or arises to him, (a) from any source in the area or Union Territories aforesaid, or (b) by way of dividend or interest on securities. \"Part of the impugned assessments were made under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and the rest, under the Income Tax Act, 1961. If the aforementioned provisions are valid, then the assessments in question are beyond challenge. Therefore the only question for decision is whether the legislature had no power to exclude the government servants from the benefit of the exemptions given under the aforementioned ss.4(3) (xxi) and 10(26).\n  It is seen that the income of the members of a scheduled tribe included in cl. 25 of Art. 366 of the Constitution and residing in my area specified in Part A or Part B of the Table appended to paragraph 20 of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, excepting 1hat of government servants is exempt from income tax. in other words, the government servant alone is excluded from the, benefit of the exemption given under the provisions quoted above. It is agreed that the respondent is a member of the scheduled tribe included in cl. 25 of Art. 366 of the Constitution, residing in an area specified in Part A of the Table appended to para. 20 of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution, but yet he had been denied the benefit of the exemption in question on the sole ground that he is in the service of the government. It may be noted that exemption both under s. 4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and under s.10(26) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was given to the members of certain scheduled tribes. For the purpose of the exemption in question the classification was made on the basis of persons being members of a particular tribe. That being so, some of the members of that tribe cannot be excluded from the benefit of those provisions unless they can be considered as belonging to a well defined class for the purpose of income tax. The respondent's contention which has been accepted by the High Court is that the government servants cannot be considered as a separate class for the purpose of income tax. On the other hand it is contended on behalf of the Department that the classification made is a reasonable one, taking into consideration administrative convenience as well as the past legislative practice and history. \n It is not in dispute that taxation laws must also pass the test of Art. 14. That has been laid down by this Court in Moopil Nair v. State of Kerala(1). But as observed by this Court in East India Tobacco Co. v. State of Andhra Pradesh(2), in deciding whether a taxation law is discriminatory or not it is necessary to bear in mind that the State has a wide discretion in selecting persons or objects it will tax, and that a statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others; it is only when within the range of its selection, the law operates un- (1) [1961] 3 S.C.R. 77. (2) [1963] 1 S.C.R. 404, 409.equally, and that cannot be justified on the basis of any valid classification, that it would be violative of Art. 14. It is well settled that a State does not have to tax everything in order to tax something. It is allowed to pick and choose districts, objects, persons, methods and even rates for taxation if it does so reasonably. The complaint in this case is that within the range of the selection made by the State for the purpose of exemption, namely, members of certain scheduled tribes residing in specified areas, the law operates unequally and the inequality in question cannot be justified on the. basis of any valid classification.\n  There can be no distinction between the income earned by government servant and that earned by a person serving in a company or under a private individual. More or less similar is the case in respect of the income earned by persons practising one or more of the professions. Admittedly the income earned by the members of the scheduled tribes residing in Khasi-Jaintia Hills. excepting in the case of government servants is exempt from income tax be it as salaried officers, lawyers, doctors or persons other walks of life. Is there any legal basis for this differentiation ? Prima facie it appears that the government servants have been discriminated against and the discrimination in question is writ large on the face of the provisions in question. \n The learned Solicitor-General contended that the classification in question can be justified on administrative grounds. He urged that a classification based on administrative convenience is a just classification in the matter of levying taxes. According to him it is easy to collect taxes from government servants. Therefore, it was permissible for the legislature to deny them the exemption extended to the other members of their tribes. \n This contention appears to be without merit. It may be that for the purpose of taxation a classification can be made on the basis of administrative convenience. But we fail to see how the case of the government servants stands on a footing different from that of the employees in statutory corporations or even well recognised firms. That apart, administrative convenience which can afford  just basis for classification must be a real and substantial one. We see no such administrative convenience. The learned Solicitor-General, next contended that 'the classification can be justified on the basis of past legislative practice and history. In this connection he invited our attention to the fact that before this country got independence, the income of the persons in the service of the government 'but serving outside British India such as in Baluchistan, or native States was subject to tax under the Indian Income Tax laws though other persons residing in those places were not subject to the income tax laws in force in British India. \n The L10 Sup C1/67-12 reason for the same is that the Indian legislature had no.\n legislative competence to tax the residents of those areas, but it had competence to tax the income of the persons in government service though they might be serving outside British India. \n The learned Solicitor-General next invited our attention to a notification issued by the Government of India as long back as 6-6-1890, under which the income earned by members of certain scheduled tribes other than those serving under the government was exempted from income tax. He also invited our attention to Finance department Notification No.\n 788F dated 21-3-1922 under which the income of indigenous hill men other than persons in the service of government, residing in certain areas were exempt from tax. On the basis of those notifications, he wanted us to spell out a well recognised legislative practice and history under which the government servants as a class were excluded from the benefit of income tax exemption extended to other persons similarly situated. In this connection, he placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Narottam Kishore Dev Varma and Ors. v. Union of India and another(1). Therein this Court was called upon to consider the validity of s. 87B of the Code of Civil Procedure which prescribed that a Ruler of a former Indian State cannot be sued in any court otherwise competent to try the suit except with the consent of the Central Government certified in writing by a Secretary to the Government. The validity of that provision was challenged on the basis of Art. 14. This Court upheld the. validity of that provision having regard to the legislative and historical background of that provision, but at the same time observed that considered in the light of basic principles of equality before law, it would be odd to allow the section to continue prospectively for all time to come. After setting out the legislative background of that provision, this Court observed: \"The legislative background to which we have referred cannot be divorced from the historical background which is to be found for instance, in Art. 362. This Article provides that in the exercise of the power of Parliament or of any legislature of any State to make laws or in the exercise of the executive power of the Union or of a State, due regard shall be had to the guarantee or assurance given under any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause (1) of Art. 291 with respect to the personal rights, privileges and dignities of a Ruler of an Indian State. This has reference to the covenants and agreements which had been entered into between the Central Government and the Indian Princes before all the Indian States were politi- (1) [1964] 7 S.C.R. 55.                         cally completely assimilated with the rest of India. The privilege conferred on the Rulers of former Indian States has its origin in these agreements and covenants. One of the privileges is that of extra territoriality and exemption from civil jurisdiction except with the sanction of the Central Government. It was thought that the privilege which was claimed by foreign Rulers and Rulers of Indian States prior to the independence of the country should be continued even after independence was attained and the States had become part of India, and that is how in 1951, the Civil Procedure Code was amended and present sections 86, 87, 87A and 87B came to be enacted in the present form.\" \nIn the background set out above this Court upheld the validity of s. 87B of the Code of Civil Procedure. \n       We know of no legislative practice. or history treating the government servants as a separate class for the purpose of income tax. The government servants' income has all along been treated in the same manner as the income of other salaried officers. We not know under what circumstances the notifications dated 5-6-1890 and 21-3-1922, referred to.\n earlier , came to be issue& But they are insufficient to prove a well established legislative practice. At the time those notifications were issued the power of the legislature to grant or withhold any exemption from tax was not subject to any constitutional limitation. Hence the validity of the impugned provisions cannot be tested from what our legislatures or governments did or omitted to do before the Constitution came into force. If that should be considered as a true test then Art. 13(1) would become otiose and most, if not all, of our constitutional guarantees would lose their content. Sri Setalvad learned counsel for the respondent is justified in his comment that classification based on past legislative practice and history does not mean that because in the past the legislature was enacting arbitrary laws it could do so now. \n It was the contention of the learned Solicitor-General that exemption from income tax was given to members of certain scheduled tribes due to their economic and social backwardness; it is not possible to consider a government servant as socially and economically backward and hence the exemption was justly denied to him. According to the Solicitor-General, once a tribal becomes a government servant he is lifted out of his social environment and assimilated into the forward sections of the society and therefore he needs no. more any crutch to lean on. This argument appears to us to be wholly irrelevant. The exemption in question was not given to individuals either on the basis of their social status or economic resources. It was given to a class. Henceindividuals as individuals do not come into. the picture.- We fail to see in what manner the social status and economic resources of a government servant can be different from that of another holding a similar position in a corporation or that of a successful medical practitioner. lawyer, architect, etc. To over-paint the picture of a government servant as the embodiment of all power and prestige would sound ironical Today his position in the society to. put it at the highest is no higher than, that of others who in other walks of life have the same income. For the. purpose of valid classification what is required is not some imaginary difference but a reasonable and substantial distinction, having regard to the purpose of the law. \n It was lastly contended by the learned Solicitor-General a contention which was not taken either in the return or before the High Court or in the appeal memo.- that it is not possible to strike down only a portion of s.\n4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income Tax Act. 1922 and s. 10(26) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, namely, the words \"provided that such member is not in the service of government\" found in s. 4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and the words \"who. is not in, the1 service of government\" in s.\n10(26) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, as those words are not severable from the rest of the provisions in which they appear. Further; according to him it cannot be definitely predicated that the legislature would have granted the exemption incorporated in those provisions without the exception made in the' case of government. servants. \nTherefore if we hold that those provisions as they stand are violative of' Art. 14 then we must strike down the aforementioned ss. 4(3)(xxi) and 10(26) in their entirety. \nWe are unable to accept the contention that the words mentioned above are not severable, from the rest of the provision in which they appear. They are easily severable. \nTaking into consideration the reasons which persuaded the legislature to grant the exemption in question we have no doubt that it would have granted that exemption even if it was aware of the fact that it was beyond its competence to exclude the government servants from the exemption in question. \n For the reasons mentioned above this appeal is dismissed with costs. \nV.P.S.\n ",

B.N.Samanta and associates\n\n    Offence U/s- 47(a) B & O Excise Act\n\n    J U D G M E N T \n 1.  The above named accused stands charged for the offence U/s.47(a) Bihar & Orissa Excise Act (in short B & O Excise Act) on the allegation for illegally possessing and selling I.D liquor. \n 2.  The case of prosecution in short is that; On 17.03.2005 while the Excise staffs were performing patrolling duty at Sec-1 Kalyani nagar area, they conducted raid to the house of the accused. On search, some specious liquid was recovered from a plastic jarrican in his possession. \n Then the SI conducted blue litmus paper test which turned into red and also conducted hydrometer chart. From the above test the SI conformed it to be nothing but 06 liters of ID liquor. On demand he unable to show any document and authority to possess the same. After that the informant seized the same. Then he collected sample liquor and destroyed the rest at the spot. After completion of enquiry the P.R U/s-47(a) B & O Excise Act against the accused to face his trial in the court of law. Hence the trial. \n 3.    The defence plea is one of complete denial and false implication. \n 4.    The point for determination in this case are: (i)    Whether on dt.17.03.2005 the SI of police recovered and seized one plastic Jarycan containing 06 liters of I.D liquor from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused? \n (ii)  Whether the seized liquid is I/D liquor or not ?\n  5.     In order to prove its case prosecution has examined only two witnesses in his behalf. Out of whom P.W.1 is the Excise Constable and P.W.2 is the independent witness of this case. On the other hand defence led no evidence in his behalf either orally or documentary. 6.    P.W.1, the Excise constable in this case has stated that on 17.03.2005 while he along with other staffs were performing patrolling duty at Sec- 1 Kalyani nagar area, they conducted raid to the house of the accused. On search, some specious liquid was recovered from a plastic jarican in his possession. Then the SI conducted blue litmus paper test which turned into red and also conducted hydrometer chart. From the above test the SI conformed it to be nothing but 06 liters of ID liquor. On demand he unable to show any document and authority to possess the same. After that the informant seized the same. Then he collected sample liquor and destroyed the rest at the spot. After completion of enquiry the P.R U/s-47(a) B & O Excise Act against the accused to face his trial in the court of law. \n 7.    The learned defence counsel vehemently urged that when the plastic jar was not produced in the court, when chemical test was not done when SI has not made any test at the spot, neither he nor the S.I is an expert to test the liquor, more over when in no form the liquid was examined by him, when there is no malakhan entry for the seized material when no batch of the seized articles was specified on the charge sheet when no conscious possession of contraband by the accused is proved. No seizure list was examined by the prosecution and no independent witness has supported the prosecution to prove the same. It is further argued that the only witness examined by the prosecution is the official witness and to appreciate the evidence of official witness great care has to be given by the court. Hence it is found that prosecution has significantly failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt against the accused and as such the case is entitled for a clear acquittal controvert the submission of the defence counsel the learned APP submitted that none prosecution of the seized article in the court and none examination of the independent witness is not fatal for prosecution. Accordingly he prays to convict of the accused. 8.             It is settled in law that such type of cases have to prove beyond all suspicion that is the liquid is seized from exclusive & conscious possession of the accused and the liquid is nothing but ID liquor. For proving the first point that is conscious possession of the contraband I had examined the evidence of P.Ws.1 who has stated that the liquor was seized from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused. But no independent witness has support the prosecution to prove the same. \n 9.            For proving the second point that is the seized liquor was I.D liquor and nothing other than it scrutinized the evidence of P.W.1, the informant of the case. He also admitted that he had not mentioned any batch no. in the seizure list, station diary had not seized by him of the case and no malakhana entry was done in the malakhana registered relating to the seized article. \n 10.           Considering the above facts and circumstances of the case I came to the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts and as such I hold that the accused is found not guilty of the offence punishable U/s-47(a) B & O Excise Act and he is acquitted thereof as per the provision of Section 248(1) of Cr.P.C. The accused be set at liberty forthwith and his bail bond stands cancelled. \n The seized sample bottle be destroyed after expiry of four months period of limitation of appeal, if no appeal is preferred and in case of appeal as per the orders of the Appellate Court.\n Enter this case as a mistake of fact.\n J.M.F.C.,Rourkela This judgment is Dictated and corrected by me and pronounced in the open court by me in my hand and the seal of the court, this 02nd day of December, 2016.\n J.M.F.C.,Rourkela List of prosecution witnesses P.W. 1       Kishore Mohan Dash P.W.2        Mukesh Badaik List of defence witnesses NIL List of Exts.

Learned Counsel appearing for the respondents would submit that he has not received any instructions and hence seeks to retire from the case. \n However, he is posted with the facts and circumstances of the case, we direct that the learned Counsel be appointed as amicus curiae on behalf of the respondents in the interest of justice. 2. The State is in appeal questioning the acquittal of the accused in the following circumstances: It was the case of the prosecution that on 10.03.2007 the accused, three in number, with an intention of committing the crime had restrained Sharanappa PW-1 unlawfully and caused grievous injuries by assaulting him with a sword and knife and attempted to commit his murder. Accused No.3 who is said to be the mother of accused Nos.1 and 2 abetted the said act and it is also alleged that accused No.2 actively participated in the commission of the offence and therefore having caused grievous injuries, on the complaint lodged by PW-4, a case was registered for the offences punishable under Sections 341, 326, 307 and 109 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\n 3. After further proceedings, the matter having been committed to the Sessions Court, charges were framed against the accused to which the accused had pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. \nThe prosecution then examined 15 witnesses and marked several exhibits and material objects. After examination of the accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the court below framed the following points for consideration. \n \"(i) Whether the prosecution has proved beyond all reasonable doubt by adducing cogent and reliable evidence stating that on 10-3-2007 at about 8.30 a.m. in the land Sy.No.91 of Koralli the accused in furtherance of their common intention wrongfully restrained C.W.2- Sharanappa to proceed in the direction in which he has right to proceed, the accused caused grievous injuries to C.W.2-Sharanappa by assaulting him from Talwar and knife and have attempted to commit the murder of C.W.2- Sharanappa by assaulting him with Talwar and axe and accused No.3 abetted accused No.1 and 2 in the commission of the said offence and thereby the accused have committed the offence punishable under Sections 341, 326, 307 and 109 R/w. Section 34 of Indian Penal Code?\n (ii) What order?\" \n 4. The background to the alleged offence committed by the accused was that the complainant's father had three brothers namely, Gurushantappa, Ranojappa and Kupendra. Kupendra was said to be no more and the family owned lands bearing Survey Number 91, 94, and 95 of Koralli village. Gurushantappa had divided the land between himself and his brothers. \n Gurushantappa's sons namely Ratanchand and Mallikarjun were quarreling amongst themselves in connection with land bearing Survey No.91 to the effect that the complainant did not have any share in the land and had called upon him not to cultivate the land and they had also instituted proceedings before the office of the Deputy Commissioner as regards their claim in respect of the land.\nBut however, the complainant was said to be cultivating the land throughout and therefore he negated the objection raised by the sons of Gurushantappa and had grown sugar cane in the said land and the brother of the complaint namely Sharanappa had obtained permission to supply sugar cane to the Bhusnoor sugar factory and had arranged for harvesting the sugar cane crop. On 09.03.2007 labourers had been engaged to harvest the sugar cane crop and when the operations were on, at about 8.30 a.m. on 10.03.2007 the complainant had visited the land and at that point he saw his brother Sharanappa and his son Hanumantharaya were at the land and Ratanchand and Mallikarjun were armed with an axe and a knife and they were all quarreling. Mallikarjun and Ratanchand were questioning Sharanappa and his nephew Hanumantharaya, as to what right they had to harvest the sugar cane and thereafter had proceeded to attack them. Ratanchand had assaulted Sharanappa with the sword on his right palm, as a result of which his thumb was said to have been severed from his hand and when the complainant and Hanumantharaya tried to intervene, the accused, it is alleged had pushed them to the ground and continued to assault Sharanappa on his left shoulder and thereby caused grievous injuries. The accused Ratanchand once again is said to have assaulted Sharanappa on the left side of his hand and neck, as a result of which he fell to the ground. Thereafter, the accused are said to have left the place on the assumption that Sharanappa was dead. There was a jeep standing by, belonging to one Babu Kalashetty on which the accused are said to have fled. It is further alleged that accused No.3 who was also present on the land, exhorted accused Nos.1 and 2 to attack Sharanappa and kill him. In the meanwhile the complainant and Hanumantharaya had brought a private jeep and thereafter they had carried Sharanappa to a Government Hospital at Aland and admitted him for treatment. It is thereafter that the Police Sub-Inspector, Aland has visited the hospital at about 10.00 a.m. and recorded the statement of the complainant and registered a case. After further investigation and after gathering other material objects, recording statements of other witnesses and after completion of proceedings, the matter was committed to the Sessions Court. \n 5. It is in this background that the Court below after having found that though it could not be denied that PW-1 had suffered serious injuries, the evidence in support of the alleged charges against the accused was the evidence of PWs-1, 4, 5 and 9. It was found that PW-1 categorically denied the presence of accused No.3 and consequently he had stated in his evidence that accused No.1 assaulted him with an axe and accused No.2 assaulted him with a sword but contrary to this PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that accused No.1 assaulted Sharanappa with an axe and accused No.2 assaulted him with a sword. Further, PW-1 in his evidence had stated that he was alone on the land but contrary to this PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that they were also present on the land at the time of the incident and that when they tried to intervene, to rescue Sharanappa, the accused No.1 threatened them and pushed them away. Therefore, the Court below has seriously doubted the very presence of PW-4 and PW-5 in view of the contradictory statements and coming from the mouth of PW-1 the injured witness. The Court below has also contemplated that if really PWs-4 and 5 were also present on the land and tried to rescue Sharanappa from the accused who were armed with a sword and an axe as alleged, it is difficult to understand as to how they had not sustained any injuries. 6. Further it was also in the evidence of PWs-4 and 5 that they carried Sharanappa to hospital in a jeep and that he was heavily bleeding and their clothes were also blood stained but interestingly the Investigating Officer had not thought it fit to seize those blood stained clothes. Further, PW-1 in his evidence has stated that at the time of incident there were 20 labourers engaged in harvesting the sugar cane crop. However, the Investigating Officer had not made any attempt to record the statement of those witnesses who were the best witnesses to speak about the incident, as they would have been totally independent witnesses. That if really such an offence had been committed, as alleged in the complaint and as stated by PWs-4 and 5, the labourers who were working in the field would have witnessed the incident. Therefore, in the absence of any such independent evidence on record, the testimony of the said witnesses has been characterized as being tutored and interested testimony, especially, when there are material contradictions as regards the weapons seized and the manner in which the same have stated to have been employed by the accused in assaulting the injured and which is contradictorily stated by the said witnesses. 7. Further, PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that immediately after the incident they carried Sharanappa first to the police station and thereafter to the hospital. But the evidence of the Investigating Officer discloses that after he was informed of the incident he had come to the hospital and recorded the statement of the complainant. \nThis is yet another contradiction which has been disbelieved by the Court as to the manner in which the incident may have occurred. \nApart from these witnesses, there were other witnesses such as PW- 9 who was a circumstantial witness of the incident and the evidence of that witness was also of no help to the prosecution. 8. Similarly, PW-6 who was the father of PW-1 had deposed that he was in his house at the time of the incident and when he visited the land, PW-1 had already been carried to the hospital for treatment and in this manner the Court below has discarded the evidence of this witness, apart from PWs-10, 12 and 14 who were all formal witnesses in respect of the panchanama and spot mahazar etc. In fact PWs-12 and 14 who are the panch witnesses and seizure mahazar, have not supported the prosecution case and they were treated as hostile witnesses. 9. Further, the Court below has discussed the evidence of PW- 3, the Medical practitioner of the Government Hospital, Aland, who had stated that Sharanappa was brought by one Nagappa for treatment and that he had been assaulted with an axe and a knife and the doctor has spoken about the serious injuries which were identified as seven in number and that the patient was shifted to a larger hospital as the injuries were very grievous in nature. Though the medical evidence clearly indicated that the victim had suffered grievous injuries, the evidence of the other witnesses was not consistent in the manner as to how those injuries were caused. 10. PW-1 deposed that there was a property dispute between his father and father of accused No.1. He has narrated that accused No.1 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm, as a result of which the thumb got severed and accused No.2 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm and also on the wrist of his left hand and accused No.1 repeated his assault with the axe on the left portion of his chest, thereafter he had lost consciousness. He had further stated that when accused Nos.1 and 2 had attacked him, there was none present on the land and that at the time of the incident accused No.3 was carrying water to her house. However, in his cross- examination he had denied that accused No.3 was present at all. \nOn which he was treated as a hostile witness and the prosecution has cross-examined him on that aspect. \n 11. PW-5 who is the son of PW-1 had stated that accused No.1 had assaulted PW-1 on his right palm with the sword as a result of which the thumb was severed and he and PW-4 intervened.\nAccused No.2 had threatened him with the axe thereafter accused No.2 continued to assault his father with an axe on the left hand causing injuries. Accused No.2 also caused injury on the left shoulder and thereafter he had lost consciousness. That accused No.3 was all along exhorting accused Nos.1 and 2 to murder Sharanappa. \n 12. Given these inconsistencies in the case of the prosecution, though it cannot be denied that PW-1 had suffered serious injuries, since the manner in which the incident had unfolded and the participation of the accused, as alleged, being inconsistently narrated by the witnesses, the trial Court has rightly felt that it was not possible to reconcile the inconsistencies and contradictions and therefore has held that prosecution has failed to bring home the charges beyond all reasonable doubt as against the accused and has acquitted them. Though the learned Additional Advocate General would make an effort to salvage the case, as could be seen from the evidence tendered, it is full of inconsistencies which cannot be reconciled and the trial Court has rightly acquitted the accused on the grounds as stated. \n 13. Hence, there is no substance in this appeal and the same stands dismissed. \n The counsel appointed as amicus curiae is entitled to a fee of Rs.3,000/- (Rupees Three Thousand Only), payable by the State. \n Sd/- JUDGE Sd/- JUDGE swk",

Counsel for the State : Sri Debasish Shit, APP\n\nCounsel for the Defence : Sri P.K.Mohapatra & associates, Advocate.\n\n                  J U D G M E N T\n 1.   Accused person stands charged for the offence U/s. 47(a) (i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act for illegal possession of I.D. Liquor. \n 2.  The story of the prosecution in brief is that on 13.05.2015 at about 8.30 a.m., while the SI of Excise Sadar Mobile in charge of Ujalpur Charge was performing patrolling duty along with staff at Kuturma area, noticed that the accused Gauranga Kishan was coming on the road by carrying one plastic jerry cane in his hand. On suspicion the SI of Excise detained him on the road and on search recovered seven litres of ID liquor containing in the said plastic jerry cane from the possession of the accused in presence of the witnesses. Thereafter he conducted blue litmus test, smell test, hydrometer test and from above tests and his prolonged service experience, he ascertained that the seized article was I.D. liquor. Then the SI of Excise has enquired into the matter and after completion of his inquiry submitted final PR against the accused person U/s. 47(a)(i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act suggesting his trial. 3.             The plea of the accused person is one of complete denial and false implication only for statistical purpose. 4.             The points for determination of this case are as follows: (i) Whether on 13.05.2015 at about 8.30 a.m., the road of Kuturma, the SI of Excise seized seven litres of ID liquor containing in one plastic jerry cane for the purpose of selling without any authority? \n (ii) Whether on the same date, time and place the said seven litres of ID liquor has been seized from your exclusive and conscious possession ? \n (iii) Whether the seized article is I.D. liquor or not? \n 5.            To prove its case, prosecution has examined only three witnesses. Out of whom P.W. 2 is the SI of Excise Sadar Mobile in charge of Ujalpur and P.W. 1 is the accompanying Excise constable. Pw 3 is the cited independent seizure witness to the alleged occurrence. Prosecution proved certain documents marked as Ext. 1 & Ext. 2. On the other hand, no oral or documentary evidence adduced on behalf of accused person in his defence. \n 6.  On analysis of the evidence on record P.W. 2 the SI of Excise deposed that on 13.05.2015, while he was performing patrolling duty at Kuturma area, found that the accused was coming on the road by holding one plastic jerry cane in his hand, so on suspicion, he detained the accused Gauranga Kishan and on search recovered seven litres of ID liquor containing in the plastic jerry cane from the possession of the accused. According to this witness, he had conducted blue litmus paper test which turned into red in colour, conducted hydrometer test and thereafter prepared the seizure list. Another official witness PW 1 (Excise constable) like wise supported the version of P.W 2 in respect of patrolling and seizure of the liquor from the possession of the accused. Specific version of both the witnesses is that seizure was conducted by the SI of Excise in presence of the witnesses. Hence, it is necessary to testify the testimony of the official witnesses from independent source for the sake of corroboration. P.W. 3, the independent seizure witness did not support the version of P.W. 2 at all in respect of factum of seizure. According to him nothing was seized in his presence by any Excise staff and he has put his thumb impression on a paper. Hence there is discrepancy between the testimony of independent seizure witness and the official witnesses. \n 7. To prove an offence U/s.47(a)(i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act, it is the bounden duty of prosecution to establish that the seizure was from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused. But in this case the seizure witness did not support the factum of seizure at all. Further the SI of Excise, PW 2 in cross-examination admitted that he had not known the accused prior to the incident. The spot is a village road and busy one. He further deposed that he has not produced the seized articles before the court nor he sent the same for chemical examination. Though the independent corroboration is not the rule but as the place of seizure is a public place, examination of independent witness is necessary to make the judgment free from any criticism. The plea of the defence is that a false case has been foisted against him only for statistical purpose. There is no material on record to show the exact place of seizure, as no sketch map is prepared or proved by the prosecution in this case to establish that the seizure was from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused. \n More so the SI of Excise neither produced the seized liquor before the court nor sent the same for chemical examination. Further, independent seizure witness did not support the factum of seizure. In such premises I hold that the prosecution failed to prove the factum of seizure from the possession of the accused for want of independent corroboration. Hence the prosecution failed to establish the seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused. \n 8.  With regard to nature of seized article whether it is liquor or not. \n P.W. 2 stated that the seized article is I.D. liquor. No document is filed or proved on behalf of prosecution to establish that P.W. 2 is competent enough to opine on the subject of liquor, spirit or intoxicant being an expert U/s. 45 of Indian Evidence Act. No distillery training certificate has been filed on his behalf. Further this witness has admittedly stated in cross- examination that he had not sent the seized article or samples for chemical examination which is one of the surest test. Hence, I hold that prosecution failed to establish that the seized article is I.D. liquor. \n 9.       In view of the whole discussions in foregoing paragraphs, since the prosecution failed to establish that the seizure is from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused, I hold that prosecution failed to establish the charge leveled against the accused person for commission of offence U/s.47(a)(i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act beyond all reasonable doubt. Hence, I acquit him therefrom under the provisions of Sec.248(1) Cr.P.C. He be set at liberty and discharged from his bail bond. Enter the case as mistake of fact. \n The seized liquor kept at Excise Malkhana, be destroyed after four months expiry of appeal period, if no appeal is preferred and in case of appeal subject to the orders of the appellate court.\n S.D.J.M.,Sundargarh.\n                                                                           19.01.2017 The judgment is transcribed and typed to my dictation, corrected by me and pronounced in the open court on this the 19th day of January, 2017 and given under my hand and seal of the court. \n S.D.J.M.

DHARMADHIKARI &\n                                                  SARANG V. KOTWAL, JJ. DATE : 29th NOVEMBER, 2018. JUDGMENT  (PER : B. P. DHARMADHIKARI, J.) : 1.  Looking to the nature of controversy we issue Rule and make it returnable forthwith. Heard learned Counsel for Petitioner and learned APP finally by consent. Learned APP is seeking time to find out the fate of acquittal order and to obtain instructions. However, we find it not necessary. \n Nesarikar 2.   After hearing respective Counsel, we find that order of proclamation u/s 82 of Code of Criminal Procedure was issued against the Petitioner on 16/07/1990 when the warrant of arrest was returned without execution, as he could not be found. \n Thereafter in due course as per order dated 17/08/1990, the learned Judicial Magistrate issued an order for attaching his property. That order was executed on 15/10/1990. \n 3.  It appears that thereafter Petitioner appeared in 2012 and the Sessions Court Sangli proceeded further with trial in Sessions Case No.204/05. By Judgment dated 04/02/2012 accused Nos.1 and 2 have been acquitted of offence punishable u/s 452, 342, 394, 366, 323 and 506 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Petitioner/accused No.1 has also been acquitted of the offence punishable u/s 376 of IPC. \n 4.  Petitioner as on 23/01/2014 moved an Application in the Court of J.M.F.C. Jat for releasing the property in his possession. That Court as on 12/03/2014 found that the Application was not filed within stipulated period as per section 85(3) of Cr.P.C. and therefore it was disposed of. It appears that he had on 10/03/2014 moved an Application for condonation of delay and with identical order said application was also disposed of. \n 5.  Learned Counsel for Petitioner submits that in fact after Petitioner appeared in Sessions Case and faced the trial, the order of attachment did not survive. It is further contended that in any case after judgment of acquittal delivered on 04/02/2012, the attachment could not have continued. She claims that acquittal has become final. \n 6.  Learned APP submits that if there be any Appeal against such acquittal, attachment may be required to be continued for securing presence of Petitioner. It is further pointed out that reason given by trial Court is valid and there is no jurisdictional error. \n 7.  Perusal of provision of section 85(3) of Cr.P.C. shows that person who seeks release of property from attachment, has to apply within two years and point out to the trial Court that property was attached without serving proper notice upon him and he was not absconding or did not conceal himself for the purpose of avoiding execution of warrant. The provision of section 85(3) of Cr.P.C. also contemplates that if trial Court is so satisfied, the property can be delivered to Petitioner after recovery of costs incurred by Government in consequence of attachment. If the property is already sold, the proportionate proceeds thereof can be made over to Applicant. \n 8.  Here Petitioner has also filed before the Court an 7/12 extract dated 28/09/2015 and it mentions ownership or possession of State Government only. \n 9.  Learned APP has also invited attention to provision of section 85(2) which stipulates that failure of Petitioner to appear within specified time after proclamation, results in keeping the property under attachment at the disposal of State Government. She submits that after following procedure in sub section (2) State Government can dispose of that property. \n 10.  In the present matter, the Petitioner No.1 has appeared before Sessions Court, faced trial and has been acquitted in 2012. It appears that even thereafter and till date, 7/12 extract mentioned supra, property has not been sold by State Government. In this situation, the question is whether the property can be restored back to Petitioner. Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in (2008) 5 BOM CR (S.C.)441, Vimalben Ajitbhai Patel vs. Vatslabeen Ashokbhai Patel and Ors., shows that attachment under Section 82 of Cr.P.C. is only for securing attendance of absconding accused. Here the accused appeared and participated in trial. Judgment dated 04/02/2012 of Sessions Court, Sangli, in Sessions Case No.204/05 clearly shows that Petitioner has been honourarily acquitted. \n 11.  The provision looked into by us, supra, show that Petitioner for that purpose has to demonstrate that the attachment was unwarranted, as he did not have notice of proceedings and he was not absconding. The application preferred by Petitioner before trial Court for restoration of possession back to him, does not show any such statement or explanation. Because of acquittal, he has moved the Application. \n He appeared in proceedings almost after 12 years. He pleaded herein that he was working at other place and earning livelihood. It is also stated that he was implicated in false case. \n The learned Court of J.M.F.C. in this situation could not have taken cognizance thereof and could not have released the property in his favour. \n 12.  However, considering the acquittal, as property is still with State Government and lying unutilized, we grant Petitioner leave to make appropriate application to State Government. If such Application is moved within three months from today, giving the necessary explanation to Respondent/State Government, then the State Government shall verify relevant facts and take suitable decision upon it within further period of six months. Observation of Sessions Court in Judgment of acquittal show that Petitioner was falsely implicated in that case. \n 13.  With these directions and keeping all other contentions of the parties open in relation thereto, we dispose of the present Writ Petition. \n (SARANG V. KOTWAL, J.)        (B. P. DHARMADHIKARI, J.)",

The\nappellant who was in charge of the goods, was arrested while\nescaping from the truck and Rs. 2000/- were seized from him. \nHis statement was recorded under S. 108, Customs Act, 1962. \nThe appellant and the driver of the truck. were convicted by\nthe Trial Court under Ss. 135 (a) and 135 (b) of the Customs\nAct. 1962, and S. 5 of the Imports & Exports (Control) Act,\n1947. The High Court upheld their conviction under S. 135\n(a) of the Customs Act, and acquitted them of the other\ncharges. In appeal by leave granted under Art. 134(1) (c) of the\nConstitution, the appellant contended before this Court that\nhis statement taken under S. 108, Customs Act, could not be\nused against him; firstly, as it was hit by Art. 20(3) of\nthe Constitution on account of its having been taken while\nhe was already an `accused' under S. 124, Bombay Police Act,\nand secondly. it was barred under S. 24, Evidence Act, the\nsame being a confession obtained under compulsion of law. It\nwas also contended that in the absence of the requisite\nnotification under S. 123(2), Customs Act, the statutory\npresumption under S. 123 could not be invoked by the\nprosecution, and without the same, the facts of the case\nwere insufficient to establish an offence against the\nappellant under S. 135, Customs Act. \n\n         Dismissing the appeal, the Court ,\n^\n\n         HELD: (1) To claim the benefit of the guarantee against\ntestimonial compulsion embodied in clause (3) of Art. 20, it\nmust be shown, firstly, that the person who made the\nstatement was `accused of any offence', secondly, that he\nmade this statement under compulsion.

From the Judgment and order dated the 26-3-71 of the Bombay High Court at Bombay in Criminal Appeal No. 1434 of 1970. \n K. R. Chaudhury and K. Rajendra Chaudhury for the Appellant. \n H. R. Khanna and M. N. Shroff for Respondent. \n         The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKARIA, J.- Veera Ibrahim, appellant was accused No. 2 in the complaint filed by Assistant Collector of Customs, Preventive Department, Bombay before the Chief Presidency Magistrate for his prosecution along with one Abdul Umrao Rauf, accused No. 1, in respect of offences under ss. 135(a) and 135(b) of the Customs Act, 1962 and s. S of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act 1947. The trial Magistrate convicted both the accused on all the three charges and sentenced them to two years rigorous imprisonment on each count with a direction that the sentences would run concurrently. Against that judgment, two separate appeals were filed by the convicts in the Bombay High Court which acquitted both the accused of the offences under s. 5 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947 and under s. 135(b) of the Customs Act, but maintained their conviction on the charge under s. 135(a) of that Act reducing the sentence to one years rigorous imprisonment, The High Court, however, granted a certificate under Article 134(1) (c) of the Constitution, on the basis of which, this appeal has been filed. \n The main question with reference to which the certificate was granted by the High Court, was: whether s.\n108 of the Customs Act, 1962 is ultra vires the provisions of cl. (3) of Article 20 of the Constitution ? But Mr.\nChaudhry, appearing for the appellant, does not press this question now before us. The first contention canvassed by the Counsel is that on the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellant's statement recorded under s. 108 of the Customs Act 1962, on the foot of which the appellant has been convicted, was hit by clause (3) of Article 20 because at the time of making that statement, the appellant was \"accused of any offence\"\nunder s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act, and the statement was obtained under compulsion of law. Stress has been placed on the fact that the appellant was, in fact, arrested by the police on a charge under s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act and the goods were seized under a Panchnama, prepared by them in the course of investigation. In this connection, reference has been made toM. P. Sharma and Ors. v. Satish Chandra, District Magistrate, Delhi and Ors.(1) On the other hand, Mr. H. R. Khanna, appearing for the respondent submits that the words \"accused of any offence\"\noccurring in Art. 20(3) take in only that person against whom a formal accusation of an offence has been levelled. \nTwo other conditions for the applicability of this Clause, according to the Counsel, are: (a) that the testimony in question had been obtained under compulsion, and (b) it relates to the offence of which he stands formally accused. \nThese conditions, it is maintained, were not fulfilled in the present case. \n Clause (3) of Article 20 provides: \"No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself\". \n         From an analysis of this clause, it is apparent that in order to claim the benefit of the guarantee against testimonial compulsion embodied in this clause, it must be shown, firstly, that the person who made the statement was \"accused of any offence\" secondly, that he made this statement under compulsion. The phrase \"accused of any offence\" has been the subject of several decisions of this Court so that by now it is well settled that only a person against whom a formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence has been levelled which in the normal course may result in his prosecution, would fall within its ambit. In R. C. Mehta v. State of West Bengal, this point came up for consideration in the context of a statement recorded by an officer of Customs in an enquiry under s. 171-A of the Sea Customs Act. One of the contentions raised was, that a person against whom such an enquiry is made is a `person accused of an offence', and on that account, he cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself and the statement obtained or evidence collected under the aforesaid provision by the officer of Customs is inadmissible. This contention was repelled. Shah J., speaking for the Court, made these apposite observations: \"Under s. 171-A of the Sea Customs Act, a Customs officer has power in an enquiry in connection with the smuggling of goods to summon any person whose attendance he considers necessary, to give evidence or to produce a document or any other thing, and by cl.\n         (3) the person so summoned is bound to state the truth upon any subject respecting which he is examined or makes statements and to produce such documents and other things as may be required. The expression \"any person\" includes a person who is suspected or believed to be concerned in the smuggling of goods. But a person arrested by a Customs officer because he is found in possession of smuggled goods or on suspicion that he is concerned in smuggling is not when called upon by the Customs officer to make a statement or to produce a document or thing, a person accused of an         offence within the meaning of Art. 20(3) of the Constitution. The steps taken by the Customs officer are for the purpose of holding an enquiry under the Sea Customs Act and for adjudging confiscation of goods dutiable or prohibited and imposing penalties. The Customs officer does not at that stage accuse the person suspected of infringing the provisions of the Sea Customs Act with the commission of any offence. His primary duty is to prevent smuggling and to recover duties of customs when collecting evidence in respect of smuggling against a person suspected of infringing the provisions of the Sea Customs Act he is not accusing the person of any offence punishable at a trial before a magistrate\". \n         After a survey of case law, the Court pointed out the circumstances, the existence of which is ordinarily necessary to clothe a person with the character of a \"person accused of an offence\": \"Normally a person stands in the character of an accused when a First Information Report is lodged.\n         against him in respect of an offence before an officer competent to investigate it, or when a complaint is made relating to the commission of an offence before a Magistrate competent to try or send to another Magistrate for trial the offence. Where a Customs officer arrests a person and informs that person of the grounds of his arrest (which he is bound to do under Art. 221) of the Constitution for the purpose of holding an enquiry into the infringement of the provisions of the Sea Customs Act which he has reason to believe has taken place, there is no formal accusation of an offence. In the case of an offence by infringement of the Sea Customs Act and punishable at the trial before a Magistrate, there is an accusation when a complaint is lodged by an officer competent in that behalf before the Magistrate\".\n          The above-quoted observations are a complete answer to the contention of the appellant. In the light of these principles, it is clear that when the statement of the appellant was recorded by the Customs officer under s. 108, the appellant was not a person \"accused of any offence\"\nunder the Customs Act, 1962. An accusation which would stamp him with the character of such a person was, levelled only when the complaint was filed against him, by the Assistant Collector of Customs complaining of the commission of offences under s. 135(a) and s. 135(b) of the Customs Act. \n         True, that the appellant was arrested by the police on December 12, 1967 on suspicion of having committed an offence under s. 124, of the Bombay Police Act and a Panchnama of the packages in the truck was also prepared. \nBut the factual ingredients of that offence are materially different from those of an offence under the Customs Act. \n This will be apparent from a bare reading of s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act, which provides : \"Whoever has in his possession or conveys in any manner, or offers for sale or pawn, anything which there is         reason to believe is stolen property or property fraudulently obtained shall, if he fails to account for such possession or to act to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, on conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a term (which may extend to one year but shall not, except for reasons to be recorded in writing, be less taken one month and shall also be liable to the fine which may extend to five hundred rupees).\n         Even in respect of that offence, the police did not register any case or enter any F.I.R. which normally furnishes a foundation for commencing a police investigation. The police did not open the packages or prepare inventories of the goods packed therein. Indeed, the police appear to have dropped further proceedings. They did not take any steps for prosecuting the appellant even for an offence under the Bombay Police Act, 1951. They informed the customs authorities, who opened the packages, inspected the goods and on finding them contraband goods, seized them under a Panchnama. The Customs authorities called the appellant and his companion to the Customs House, took them into custody, and after due compliance with the requirements of law, the Inspector of Customs questioned the appellant and recorded his statement under s. 108 of the Customs Act. \nUnder the circumstances it was manifest that at the time when the Custom officer recorded the statement of the appellant, the latter was not formally \"accused of any offence.\" The High Court was therefore right in holding that the statement recorded by the Inspector of Customs was not hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution. The next question to be considered is, whether this statement was hit by s. 24 of the Evidence Act. The contention is that this statement was obtained under compulsion of law inasmuch as he was required to state the truth under threat of prosecution for perjury. \n         For reasons that follow, we are unable to sustain this contention. \n         To attract the prohibition enacted in s. 24, Evidence Act, these facts must be established: (i) that the statement in question is a confession; (ii) that such confession has been made by an accused person; (iii)that it has been made to a person in authority; (iv) that the confession has been obtained by reason of any inducement, threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority; (v) such inducement, threat or promise, must have reference to the charge against the accused person; (vi) the inducement, threat or promise must in the opinion of the Court be sufficient to give the accused person grounds, which would appear to him reasonable, for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him. \n         In the present case, facts (i), (iv) and (vi) have not been established. Firstly, the statement in question is not a \"confession' within the contemplation of s. 24. It is now well-settled that a statement in order to amount to a \"confession\" must either admit in terms the offence, or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute the offence. An admission of an incriminating fact, howsoever grave, is not by itself a confession. A statement which contains an exculpatory assertion of some fact, which if true, would negative the offence alleged, cannot amount to a confession (see Pakala Narayana v. R.; Plavinder Kaur v.\nState of Punjab; Om Prakash v. State.\n          A perusal of the statement Ex. I made by the appellant before the Inspector of Customs would show that it contained exculpatory matter. Therein, the deponent claimed that he was not aware that the packages which were loaded in the truck were contraband goods, and alleged that the goods were not loaded under his instructions. The deponent claimed to be an innocent traveller in the truck when he said: \"I did not ask Mullaji (driver) what goods were being loaded in his lorry... Mullaji was only my friend and I was not aware of any of his mala fide activities\". \n         Moreover, the incriminating facts admitted in this statement, do not, even if taken cumulatively amount to admission of all the facts which constitute any offence. To bring home an offence under s. 135 of the Customs Act, in addition to the facts admitted in Ex. I, it had to be established further that these goods were contraband goods. \n         For these reasons, it could be said beyond doubt, that the statement Ex. 1 was not a \"confession\" within the meaning of s. 24, Evidence Act. \n         Secondly, it has not been shown that the Customs officer-though a person in authority-had offered any inducement or held out any threat or promise to the appellant. \n         Christopher Soares, the Inspector of (Customs (P. W. 4) testified that no threats, coercion or inducements were used and that the statement Ex. 1 was made by the appellant, voluntarily.\n          While it may be conceded that a person summoned by an officer of Customs to make a statement under s. 108 of the Customs Act, is under compulsion of law to state the truth, the compulsion there under, assuming it amounts to a threat, does not proceed \"from a person in authority\" within the contemplation of s. 24, but emanates from law. \n         Thirdly, the mere fact that the Inspector of Customs had, before recording the statement, warned the deponent of the possibility of hisprosecution for perjury in case he did not make the statement truthfully, cannot be construed as a threat held out by the officer which could have reasonably caused the person making the statement to suppose that he would by making that statement, gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him for smuggling.\n          In view of what has been said above, we have no hesitation in holding that the statement Ex. 1, was not barred under s. 24, Evidence Act. The statement Ex. P-1 was clearly admissible under s. 21, Evidence Act as an admission of incriminating facts. \n         Lastly, Mr. Chaudhry tried to contend that the incriminating facts admitted in Ex. 1 taken along with the other facts appearing in the evidence of prosecution witnesses, were insufficient to establish an offence under s. 135, Customs Act against the appellant because no notification under sub-s. (2) of s. 123, of the Customs Act had been issued in respect of the import of the goods of the kind seized, and the aid of the statutory presumption under that section was not available to the prosecution.\n  We are unable to accept this contention. While it is true that in the absence of the requisite notification, the statutory presumption under s. 123 could not be invoked by the prosecution, the circumstances established unerringly raise an inference with regard to all the factual ingredients of an offence under s. 135(b) read with s.\n 135(ii) of the Customs Act. In Ex. 1 which was proved by P.W. 4, it is admitted that these packages which were later found to contain contraband goods by the Customs authorities, were surreptitiously loaded in the truck under cover of darkness at Reti Bunder (sea shore) from the side of sea-side wall, in the presence of the appellant, and thereafter the first accused took the wheel, while the appellant sat by his side in the truck, and drove towards Sandhurst Station. It is further admitted that some Bania paid Rs. 2,000/- to the appellant which was meant to be given to the driver of the truck. Unfortunately, the truck skidded near the Dongri Police Station and came to a stop. On hearing the impact of the accident, the police came out, took both the accused into the Police Station and seized the truck and the goods. In short, the. appellant had clearly admitted that these packages containing the contraband goods were imported surreptitiously from Reti Bunder under cover of darkness. It was further established de-hors the statement of the appellant, that these packages, on opening by the Customs officer, were found to contain contraband goods of foreign make. They were brand new articles packed. \n The circumstances of the arrest of the appellant while escaping from the truck, the seizure of the truck and the goods, the contraband nature of the goods, the fact that at the time of the seizure, the goods, were in the charge of the appellant, the fact that no duty on these goods had been paid, the seizure of Rs. 2,000/- as cash from the appellant etc. were proved by evidence aliunde rendered by P. Ws. 1 and 2. To some extent, the hostile witness, P.W. 5, also, supported the prosecution. The circumstances established unmistakably and irresistibly pointed to the conclusion that the appellant was knowingly concerned in a fraudulent attempt at evasion, if not, fraudulent evasion, of duty chargeable on those contraband goods. \n In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed. \n M.R.                     Appeal dismissed.",

The conference passeda number of resolutions. The draft\nof one of the resolutions was put in shape by the respondent\nWho was a member of the Dravida Kazhagam. It was however\nmoved by the president of the conference and passed by the\nconference. The appellants were either editors or publishers\nof newspapers in which a news item was published about the\nconference. The news item however did not mention either\nthe Dravida Kazhagam or the respondent or any sponsor of the\nresolution eithter by name or otherwise. The respondent\nwrote letter to the appellants, signing and describing\nhimself' as Chairman of the Reception Committee of the\nconference, containing that the news item had distorted the\nresolution and asked them to publish a correction and\nclarification. A few days later, a lawyers notice was sent\nto the appellants in which the respondent complained that\nthe news item was defamatory and had tarnished the image of\nthe conference and demanded an apology. Thereafter, the\nrespondent filed a complaint under Ss. 500 and 501, I.P.C.\nagainst the appellants as they did not tender any apology. \non the basis of the complaint and the evidence he recorded,\nthe Magistrate issued process. The appellants moved the\nHigh Court under s. 561 A, Cr-. P.C., for quashing the\nproceedings. They contended that the respondent was not ,in\naggrieved part\\, within the meaning of s. 198, Cr.P.\nC., that he had filed the complaint in his capacity as\nChairman of the Reception Committee of the conference and\nnot in his individual capacity, that in the absence of any\nreference to him in the news item he had no cause for a\ncomplaint, and that the conference, 'being an undefined and\nan amorphous body, the respondent, is a member or part of\n\nsuch body, could not lodge the complaint. The High Court,\n\nhowever, held that the respondent was a member of the\n\nDravida Kazhagam which was an identifiable group, and was\n\ntherefore a person aggrieved within the meaning of s. 198,\n\nCr.P.C.\n\nAllowing the appeal to this Court and quashing ;the\n\nproceedings taken by     the Magistrate,\n\nHELD: (1) Under s. 198, Cr.P.C. , no Magistrate can take\n\ncognizance of an offence falling inter alia under Chap.\n\nXXI, I.P.C., that is, ss. 499 to 502, except on a\n\ncomplaint made by some persons aggrieved by such offence. \n\nThe section is mandatory, so 'that, if a Magistrate were to\n\ntake cognizance of the offence of defamation on a complaint\n\nfiled by one who is not an aggrieved person the trial and\n\nconviction of the accused would be void and illegal. [48A-C]\n\n(2)Section 499, I.P.C., defines defamation and lays down\n\nthat whoever by words, either spoken or intended to be read\n\nor by signs etc., makes\n\nor publishes any imputation concerning any person intending\n\nto harm or knowing or having reason to believe that the\n\nimputation will harm the reputation of such person is said\n\nto defame that person. Explanation 2 to the section lays\n\ndown that it may amount to defamation to make an imputation\n\nconcerning a company or an association or collection of\n\npersons. But such a collection of persons must be an\n\nidentifiable body, so, that, it is possible to say with\n\ndefiniteness that a group of particular persons ,is\n\ndistinguished from the rest, of the community, was defamed. \n\nTherefore, in a case where Explanation 2 is resorted to the\n\nidentify of the company or the association or the collection\n\nof persons must be established so as to be relatable to the\n\ndefamatory words or imputations. If a well defined class is\n\ndefamed, every particular member' of that class can file a\n\ncomplaint even if the defamatory imputation does not mention\n\nhim by name. [48C-G, 50C, G-H] \n\n(3)The test whether the members of a class deamed are or\n\nnot would not be apt in a criminal prosecution where, \n\ntechnically speaking, it is not by the persons injured but\n\nby the state that criminal proceedings are carried on and a\n\ncomplaint can. lie in a case of libel against a class of\n\npersons provided always that such in class is not\n\nindeterminate or 'indefinite but, a definite one.

Emperor, A.I.R. 1935 All. 743, referred to.\n\n(4)But in the present case, the conference was a body\n\ndistinct from the Dravida Kazhagam party. That the\n\nconference was organised by the party would not mean that\n\nboth were the same or that the members of the party any\n\nthose of the conference or those who, attended it were the\n\nsame. In fact, the principal function of the reception\n\ncommittee would be to enroll members of the conference and\n\ncollect funds to defray its expenses. The evidence of the\n\nrespondent also indicated that the conference was attended\n\nnot only by members of the Dravida Kazhagam party but also\n\nby outsiders. it is therefore wrong to identify one with the\n\nother or to say that a defamation of the conference as a\n\nclass or collection of persons was defamation of the Dravida\n\nKazhagam party. The news item complained of clearly stated\n\nthat the resolution was by the conference and not by the\n\n\nDravida Kazhagam. The respondent in his letters made no\ngrievance that the Drivida Kazhagam suffered injury in\nreputation or otherwise by 'the alleged distortion. His case\nthroughout was that the publication had tarnished the\nimage.not of the Dravida Kazhagam, but of the conference. [51C-G; 52A-B] \n(6) Therefore, the High Court missed the realissue. Whether\nthe Dravida Kazhagam was an identifiable group or not was\nbeside the point, for, what had to be decided was whether\nthe conference was a determinate and identifiable body so\nthat defamatory words used in relation to the resolution\nwould be defamation of the individuals who composed it.and\nthe respondent, as one of such individuals could maintain\ntile complaint. f.@ 2C-F ]\n(7) The conference clearly was not an identifiable or\ndefinitive body so that all those who attended it could be\nsaid to be its constituents, who. if the conference was\ndefamed, would, in their turn, be said to be defamed. It is impossible to have any definite idea as to its\ncomposition, the number of persons who attended, the ideas\nand ideologies to which they subscribed, and whether all of\nthem positively agreed to the resolution in question. The\nevidence was that the person presiding read out the\nresolution and because no one got up to oppose it was taken\nas approved by all.[52F-H]\n\nJUDGMENT: \nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Criminal Appeal Nos. 18, 53 and 54 of 1972.\nAppeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated November 2, 1971 of the Madras High Court in Criminal Misc.\nPetition Nos. 2093, 2089, 2091 of 1971. \nM.

Nos. 53 & 54/72). \nThe Judgment of the court was delivered by SHELAT, J.- These appeals, founded on special leave, are directed against the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Madras dismissing the applications filed by the appellants for quashing charges under ss. 500 and 501 of the Penal Code framed by the Presidency Magistrate, Madras. The common question raised in all these appeals is whether the respondent (the original complainant) was an aggrieved person competent to file the said complaints within the meaning of S. 198 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with s. 499, Explanation (2) of the Penal Code. \nThe complaint came to be filed in the following circumstances The Dravida Kazhagam, a party having a platform for social reforms, has, according to counsel for the respondent, a membership of about 4000 persons in Madras city and elsewhere. The aims and objects of the party are to bring about social reforms and in particular to eradicate certain customs and practices, which, according to its promoters, are sheer superstitions. The party sponsored and organised a conference, which held its sessions on January 23 and 24, 1971. The conference passed a number of resolutions, the one relevant for these appeals was, as translated in Eng- lish, by the High Court, as follows : \"It should not be made an offence for a person's wife to desire another man. \"The object of this resolution, according to the respondent, was to, achieve total emancipation of women and to establish absolute equality in social life between men and women. The appellants are and were at the material time the editors, and publishers of three daily newspapers, the Dinmani, the Hindu and the Indian Express, all printed and published in Madras. In the issues of January 25 and 26, 1971 there appeared in the Hindu, as also in the other two papers, a news item under the caption \"Demonstration against the Obscene Tableau\" in which among other things was published the following : .lm15 \"The Conference passed a resolution requesting the Government to take suitable steps to see that coveting another man's wife is made an offence under the Indian Penal Code.\" \nThe news item emanated from a report from a correspondent, dated January 24, 1971. The news item reported that about 300 persons had staged a black flag demonstration against the procession taken out in connection with the said conference in which tableau alleged to be obscene and depicting certain Hindu deities and mythological figures formed part. The processionists shouted anti-God slogans, which were replied to by the demonstrators with counter slogans. The news item further reported that E. V. Rama- swami Naicker, the leader of the Dravida Kazhagam, seated in a tractor, was at the rear of the procession. He also presided over the said conference which was inaugurated by one C.D. Naidu. The respondent's case was that what came to be. published in the said news item was not the actual resolution passed by the conference, but the reverse of it. \nBut the news item stated that it was the conference 'and not the Dravida Kazhagam which had passed the resolution set out in it as aforesaid. \nOn January 28, 1971, the respondent, signing as the chairman of the reception committee of the said conference, called upon the editor of the Hindu to publish a correction and clarification stating that the resolution published in that daily was distorted version of the resolution actually passed by the conference, that the resolution passed by the conference was that \"it should not be made an offence for a person's wife to desire another man\", and not that a man coveting another man's wife should not be an offence, and that those who were aware of the opinions of the said E V.\nRamaswami Naicker would find that the resolution was in keeping with his views, namely, that marriage was a contract terminable at the instance of either party and not an interminable sacrament, and lastly, that the resolution was intended to highlight the disabilities of women which prevented them,from attaining their full stature. On February 1971, the Hindu published the said clarification as demanded by the respondent under the caption \"Salem Conference Resolutions\"\ntogether with the version of its own representative at Salem according to which the resolution passed by the conference was the one ,Published in the Hindu On February 1, 1971, the respondent, by his Advocate's letter, called upon the editor to publish the correct text of the resolution starting that what was published in the Hindu was \"not only a travesty of truth but also highly defamatory so as to tarnish the image of the conference\", of whose reception committee he was the chairman and called upon the editor to express an apology. \nNo such apology having been tendered, the respondent filed complaints on February 9, 1971 against the editors and publishes of the three dailies under ss. 500 and 501 of the Penal Code in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Madras. In these complaints, the respondent described himself as an important member of the Dravida Kazhagam and of the Self-respect Movement organised by that party, as also an ardent disciple of its leader, the said E. V.\nRamaswami Naicker. He further stated that the Dravida Kazhagam had organised the said conference for the eradication of superstitious beliefs, that he was the chairman of its reception committee, that the conference passed several resolutions, one of which was the resolution advocating that it should not be an offence for a person's wife to ;desire another man, that he was one of the members responsible \"'for sponsoring and piloting that resolution\", that the conference was attended \"by a large number of leaders, members, followers. sympathizers of the Kazhagam, besides a large number of public at large, occupying varied strata of the society\" and that the Hindu published a wrong version of the said resolution implying that the resolution advocated adultery, an offence under the Penal Code. The complaint further stated that the news item published in the newspaper was quite contrary to the actual resolution passed by the conference, that it contained \"imputations ,on the sponsors of the resolution\" by publishing the resolution ,in a distorted and false form thereby lowering in the estimation of those Who read the said news them the complainant and other members of the party responsible for sponsoring the resolution. making out by such imputation that the sponsors of the resolution \"have stooped to the level of passing a resolution requesting the Government to legalese adultery which will tend to degrade social life\". To the complaint was attached a list of witnesses. who, we were told by the respoildent's counsel, were all bers of the Dravida Kazhagain. \nIt may be recalled that though the complaint alleged that the impugned news item contained imputations against the spon-sors of the said resolution, no such imputations, either against the respondent or the sponsors of the resolution, are to be found therein. A persual of the news items shows that it concerned. itself with the protest demonstration against the procession taken, out on that occasion and the tableau,presented in the procession, the resolution in question passed at the conference held there,after and the fact of the said E. V. Ramaswami Naicker having presided over that conference. The news item, thus, did not mention either the respondent or any of the alleged sponsors of the. \nsaid resolution either by name or otherwise, In his sworn statement before the Magistrate at the time when he presented the complaint on February 9, 1971, the respondent himself stated that the conference was organised by the Dravida Kazhagam and that it was the conference which had passed the said resolution. He, however, insisted that the impugned news item was motivated and malacious and was calculated to affect the leader of the movement and its members, including himself and was per se defamatory of the- persons who sponsored the resolution, namely, the members of the Dravida Kazhagam. In the evidence he gave before the Magistrate on May 22, 1971, the respondent claimed that it was he, who, as the chairman of the reception committee of the conference, had scrutinised and given shape to the draft resolution sent at the conference for being-moved thereat, that the said draft resolution was sent by one Pariaswami, the Secretary of the Trichy District branch of the Dravida Kazhagam, and which he had settled in the abridged form in which the conference on January 24, 1971 ultimately passed unanimously. He also deposed that the conference consisted of \"comrades of our movement, other social reform minded sympathisers and about 5000) women\". In regard to the conference and its set up, he said' that on December 13, 1970 a meeting was held for organising the conference. At that meeting one or two persons suggested that he should be the chairman of the reception committee, and that was how he was selected as the chairman. One Pachaimuthu and R. Natesan were appointed secretaries of the conference and they were responsible for the proceedings. \nThe object of the conference was \"generally to do away with all superstitious beliefs relating to religion and relating to society\". The conference had its own office and it was there that correspondence relating to its work was dealt with. He claimed that as the chairman of the reception committee, the entire responsibility for the conference was his but admitted that there was no record to show either his selection or his functions and duties or his responsibilities. Asked about the procedure followed at the conference, he said that \"nobody spoke. proposed individually each resolution or seconded\". Regarding the resolution in-question, he said that \"after the President Pariyar proposed nobody announced opposition to the resolution. The meaning is, that all approved\". Two facts clearly emerge from this evidence, (1) that though the conference was organised by the Dravida Kazhagam, it was a separate body with its own Organisation and office where correspondence relating to it was received and dealt with and had its own secretaries, and (2) that though the draft of the resolution was prepared and sent to the conference by the secretary of the Tricy District branch and was put in shape by the respondent, it was moved by the president of the conference and passed by the conference which, as testified by the respondent, ;consisted of members of the Dravida Kazhagam, sympathisers of its social reform programme, other social reform leaders and ,outsiders, including about 5000 women. The resolution was thus the resolution of the conference and not of the Dravida Kazhagam, though it was organised by that party. The resolution having been moved by the President himself, there was, also ,no question of the respondent or any other person having piloted it at the conference. \nThe Magistrate, on the basis of the complaint and the evi- dence he recorded, decided to issue process and to proceed with the trial. The appellants in all, these appeals thereupon approached the High. Court under s. 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the said proceedings. The appellants' main contention before the High Court was that the respondent was not an aggrieved party within the meaning of s. 198 of the Code, that he had filed the complaint in his capacity as the chairman. of the reception committee of the conference and not in 'his individual capacity, that in the absence of any reference to him in the said news item he had no cause for complaint, and that the conference being an undefined and an amorphous body, the respondent as a member or part of such a body could not lodge the complaint. A learned Single Judge of the High Court, who heard the said applications, rejected the said contention in the following words : \"The Dravida Kazhagam is an identifiable group, The complainant is a member of this Kazhagam. He was the Chairman of the Reception Committee in the conference. He is active member of the Dravida Kazhagam. He was one of those who piloted and sponsored the resolution. Certainly be is a person aggrieved                         within the meaning of section 19B of the Criminal procedure Code. The complaint by him is competent.\" \nThe statement in this para that the respondent piloted and sponsored the resolution in question was factually incorrect, as the respondent's evidence itself showed that the resolution was moved not by him, but by the President of the conference, who read it out and as no one opposed, it was taken to have been approved by all. The, only thing which the respondent claimed to have done as the chairman of the reception committee was to give shape to the, draft resolution by abridging it. The respondent may have been interested in the resolution and its being passed, but the resolution certainly was neither moved nor piloted by him. \nIndeed, if any one could be said to have piloted it, it was the president of the conference. Furthermore, the resolution was of the conference and the only contribution of the respondent to it was his having given shape to the original draft. \nCounsel for the appellants seriously challenged the correct- ness of the paragraph from the High Court's judgment quoted above, that being the really operative and decisive part of the judgment, firstly, on the ground that those observations were not in consonance with s. 198 of the Code even when read with s. 499, Expl (2) of the Penal Code, and secondly, on the ground of the failure of the High Court to perceive the separate entities of the Dravida Kazhagam and the conference and its omission to realise that the, resolution was the resolution of the Conference and not of the Dravida Kazhagam. The news item in question referred to the conference and not to the Dravida Kazhagam, and therefore, if anybody was defamed by the said news item, it was the conference and not the 'Dravida Kazhagam which had only organised that conference. Mr. Frank Anthony, on the other hand, urged that though it was the, conference which had passed the resolution and though the news item referred to that conference and not to the Dravida Kazhagam and the respondent was not mentioned or referred to therein, in substance and in effect it was the Dravida Kazhagam which was defamed, for, it was that party which had organised the conference and sponsored the resolutions passed thereat. Therefore, the respondent, as a leading member of that party and the chairman of the reception committee, could claim that the defamatory imputations in the said news item were, relatable to him and the other members of the Dravida Kazhagam, and he was consequently entitled to file the complaint. On these contentions, the principal question for determina- tion is whether the respondent could be said to be an aggrieved person entitled to maintain the complaint within the meaning of s. 198 of the Code. That section lays down that no magistrate shall take cognizance of an offence falling inter alia under Ch. XXI of the Penal Code (that is, ss. 499 to 502) except upon a complaint made by some persons aggrieved of such offence. Sec. 198, thus, lays down an exception to the general rule that a complaint 'can be filed by anybody whether he is an aggrieved person or not and modifies that rule by permitting only an aggrieved person to move a magistrate in cases of defamation. The section is mandatory, so that if a magistrate were to take cognizance of the, offence of defamation on a complaint filed by one who is not an aggrieved person, the ;trial and conviction of an accused in such a case by the magistrate would be void and illegal. \n Prima facie, therefore, if s. 193 of the Code were to be noticed by itself, the complaint in the present case would be unsustainable, since the news item in question did not mention the respondent nor did it contain any defamatory imputation against him individually. Sec. 499 of the Penal Code, which defines defamation, laid down that whoever by words, either spoken or intended to be read or by signs etc.\n makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm or knowing or having reason to believe that the imputation will harm he reputation of such person, is said to defame that person. This part of the section makes defamation in respect of an individual an offence. \n But Explanation (2) to the section lays down the rifle that it may amount to defamation to make an imputation concerning a company or an association or collection of persons as such. A defamatory imputation against a collection of persons thus falls within the definition of defamation. The languageage of the Explanation is wide, and therefore, besides a company or  an association, any collection of persons would be covered by it   But such a collection of persons must be an identifiable body so that it is possible to say with definiteness that a group of particular persons, as distinguished. from the rest of the community, was defamed Therefore, in a case where Explanation (2) is re- sorted to, the identity of the company or the association or the collection of persons must be established so as to be relatable to the defamatory words or imputations. Where a writing inveigh,,,, against mankind in a general. or against a particular order of men, e.g., men of own, it is no libel. It must descend to particulars and individual-, to make it a libel(1). In England also. criminal proceedings would lie in the case of libel against a class provided such a class is not indefinite, e.g. men of science. but a definite one. such as, the clergy of the diocese of Burham, the (1) (1699)3 Balk 224, cited in Ratanlal and Dhirajlal Law of Crimes (23nd ed.) 1317.\n justices of the peace for the county of Middlesex. (see Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law (19th ed.) 235. If a well- defined class is defamed, every particular member of that class can file a cornplaint even if the defamatory imputation in question does not mention him by name. \n In this connection, counsel for the appellants leaned heavily on K nupffer v. London Express Newspaper Ltd.(1). The passage printed and published by the respondents and which was the basis of the section there read as follows : \"The quislings on whom Hitler flatters himself he can build a pro-German movement within the Soviet Union are an emigre group called Hlado Russ or Young Russia. They are a. minute body professing a pure Fascist ideology who have long sought a suitable Fuehrer-I know with what success.\" \nThe appellant, a Russian resident in London, brought the action alleging that the aforesaid words had been falsely and maliciously printed and published of him by the respondents. The evidence was that the Young Russia party had a total membership of 2000, that the headquarters of the party were first in Paris but in 1940 were shifted to America. The evidence, however, showed that the appellant had joined the party in 1928, that in 1935 he acted as the representative of the party and as the head of the branch in England, which had 24 members. The appellant had examined witnesses, all of whom had said that when they read the said article their minds went up to the appellant. The House of Lords rejected the action, Lord Simon saying that was an essential element of the cause of action in a libel action that the words complained of should be published of the plaintiff, that where he was not named, the test would be whether the words would reasonably lead people acquainted with him to the conclusion that he was the person referred to. The question whether they did so in fact would not arise if they could not in law be regarded as capable of referring to him, and that was not so as the imputations were in regard respect of the party which was in Paris and America. Lord Porter agreed with the dismissal of the action but based his decision on the ground that the body defamed had a membership of 2000, which was considerable, a fact vital in considering whether the words in question referred in fact to the appellant. The principle laid down here was that there can be no civil action for libel if it relates to a class of persons who are too numerous and unascertainable to join as plaintiffs. A single one of them could maintain such an action only if the words complained of were published \" of the plaintiff\", that is to say, if the words were capable of a conclusion that he was the person referred to. (see Gatley on (1) [1944] A.C. 116.\n348SupCI/73Libel and Slander (6th ed.) 288. Mr. Anthony, however, was right in submitting that the test whether the members of a class defamed are numerous or not would not be apt in a criminal prosecution where technically speaking it is not by the persons injured but by the state that criminal proceedings are carried on and a complaint can lie in a case of libel against a class of persons provided always that such a class is not indeterminate or indefinite but a definite one. Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law (19th ed.) 235. It is true that where there is an express statutory provision, as in s. 499, Expl. (2), the rules of the Common Law of England cannot be applied. But there is no difference in principle between the rule laid down in Explanation (2) to s. 499 and the law applied in such cases in England. When, therefore, Expl. (2) to s. 499 talks of a collection of persons as capable of being defamed, such collection of persons must mean a definite and a determinate body. \nThis was the construction of Expl. (2) to s. 499 adopted in Sahib Singh Mehra v. U.P.(1) and which guided the decision in that case. The article complained of there was one printed and published in the appellant's newspaper called Kaliyug of Aligarh which contained the following : \"How the justice stands at a distance as a helpless spectator of the show as to the manner in which the illicit bribe money from plaintiffs and defendants enters into the pockets of public prosecutors and assistant public prosecutors and the extent to, which it reaches and to which use it is put.\" This Court held that the prosecuting staff of Aligarh and even the prosecuting staff in the State of U.P. formed an identifiable group or \"collection of persons\" within the meaning of s. 499, Expl. (2) in the sense that one could with certainty say that a group of persons has been defamed as distinguished from the rest of the community, and therefore, a complaint by the Public Prosecutor and eleven Assistant Public Prosecutors was a competent complaint. Following the test laid down in this decision. the High Court of Allahabad in Tek Chand v. R. K. Karanjia (2 held that the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak was a definite and an iden- tifiable body, that defamatory imputations regarding it would be defamation within the meaning of s. 499, Exp. (2), that such imputations would be defamation of the individual members of that body or class and that a complaint by an individual member of such a body was maintainable. (see also the dictum of Kendall, J.  in Wahid Ullah Ansari v.\n Emperor(3).\n (1) [1965] 2 S.C.R. 823, 828.\n (2) [1969] Cr. L.J,536.\n (3) A.I.R. 1935 All. 743. This being the position in law, the question upon which these appeals must be decided is: which was the class or body in respect of which defamatory words were used and whether that body was a definite and an identifiable body or class so that the imputations in question can be said to relate to its individual components enabling an individual member of it to maintain a complaint ?\n  The High Court, after citing Tek Chand's case(1) went on to say that the Dravida Kazhagam was an identifiable group, that the respondent was an active member of that body, that he was also the chairman of the reception committee of the conference and that he was one of those who piloted and sponsored the resolution, which was said to have been wrongly reproduced and distorted in the news item in question. Apart from the fact already mentioned by us earlier that neither the complaint nor the evidence of the respondent indicated that the resolution was piloted by him, the news item nowhere referred to or even mentioned the Dravida Kazhagam. As already pointed out, the conference was a body distinct from that party, having its own Organisation, its own secretaries who dealt with the correspondence to and by the conference and its own office where its work was conducted. No doubt, the conference was organised by the Dravida Kazhagam, but that would not mean that both were the same or that the members of the Dravida Kazhagam and those of the conference or those who attended it were the same. Indeed, the principal function of the reception committee would be to enroll members of the conference and thus collect funds to defray its expenses. \n In fact, the evidence of the respondent indicated that the conference was attended not only by the members of the Dravida Kazhagam but also by outsiders who included as many as 5000 women. It is therefore, wrong to identify one with the other or to say that defamation of the conference as a class or collection of persons was the defamation of the Dravida Kazhagam. That was not and indeed could not be the case of the respondent. \n The news item complained of clearly stated that the resolu- tion was passed by the conference and not by the Dravida Ka- zhagain. In his very first letter, dated January 28, 1971, which the respondent signed describing himself as the chairman of the reception committee and not as, an important member of the Dravida Kazhagam, the respondent complained that the news item had distorted the resolution passed by the conference and asked the editor to publish his \"correction and clarification of that resolution. There is no grievance there that the Dravida Kazhagam suffered injury in reputation or otherwise by that alleged (1) [1969] Cr. L.J. 536.distortion. In his advocates letter dated February 1, 1971, the respondent's complaint was that the news item was highly defamatory and had tarnished the image of the conference of whose reception committee he was the chairman. In his evid- ence before the Magistrate also as clearly stated that the resolution was the resolution moved by the president of the committee and passed by the conference. Thus, his case throughout was that the publication of the said resolution reported in the said news item in a distorted form had tarnished the image not of the Dravida Kazhagam but of the conference. \nThat being so, the High Court completely missed the real issue, viz., whether the conference was a determinate and an identifiable body so that defamatory words used in relation to the resolution passed by it would be defamation of the individuals who composed it, and the respondent, as one such individuals and chairman of its reception committee could maintain a complaint under s. 500 of the Penal Code. \nWhether the Dravida Kaghagam was an identifiable group or not was beside the point, for, what had to be decided was whether the conference which passed the resolution in question and which was said to have distorted was such a determinate body, like the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak in Tek Chand's case(',) or the body of public prosecutors in Sahib Singh Mehra's case(1) as to make defamation with respect to it a cause of complaint by its individual members. In our view the High Court misdirected itself by missing the real and true issue arising in the applications before it and deciding an issue which did not arise from those applications. The judgment of the High Court, 'based on an extraneous issue, therefore, cannot be sustained. \nIn this view of the matter, we would have ordinarily remanded the case to the High Court. But such a procedure appears to be unnecessary, as in our view, the conference was not such a determinate class like the one in the cases referred to earlier, where complaints by its individual member or members were held maintainable. It is impossible to have any definite idea as to its composition, the number of persons who attended, the ideas and the ideologies to which they subscribed, and whether all of them positively agree d to the resolution in question. The evidence simply was that the person presiding it read out the resolution and because no one got up to oppose it was taken as approved of by all. The conference clearly was not an identifiable or a definitive body so that all those who attended it could be said to be its constituents who, if the conference was defamed, would, in their turn, be said to be defamed. \n(1) [1969] Cr. L.J. 535.\n(2) [1965] 2 S.C.R. 823, 82In these circumstances and for the reasons set out above, we allow these appeals, set side the order of the High Court and quash the proceedings taken out by the Magistrate on the ground that the respondents compaint was not competent. \n V.P.S.               Appeals allowed.",

The accused is on bail and is absent in the Court today. 2. Briefly stated, the case of the prosecution is that on 09.12.2001 at about 12.30 PM in Turiberna area while Md. Zamir Hussain, S.I. Of Excise, Panposh, Rourkela was performing patrolling duty along with other official staffs, they conducted raid in the house of the accused and recovered one plastic jerrycane containing 10 litres of country made mahua liquor. After that S.I. Of Excise conducted smell test, tongue test, blue litmus paper test, hydrometer test. By conducting hydrometer test, the temperature was found to be 720 F, indication to be 82.6 and strength to be 52.20 UP. Out of his distillery training and experience ascertained that the liquid was nothing but I.D liquor. On being asked, the accused could not produce any licence or authority with respect to same. After measurement through litre measure, the whole quantity was found to be 10 litres. Seizure was effected and then seizure list was prepared. The S.I of Excise, arrested the accused and forwarded her to the court. After completion of inquiry, he submitted P.R.\nagainst the accused u/s. 47 (a) of the B & O Excise Act to face her trial . \nHence, this case. 3. The Plea of the defence is of outright denial and false implication. 4. The following points arose for determination in the present case: I. Whether on 09.12.2001at about 12.30 P.M. at Turiberna area, Munia Puran, the accused, was detected by the Excise officials to be in exclusive and conscious possession of one plastic jerrycane containing 10 litres of I.D liquor without any license or authority? II. Whether the seized article was nothing but I.D liquor? 5. In order to substantiate its case prosecution has examined 2 witnesses in all out of whom P.W. 1 is the independent witness to the seizure and Ext. 2 is the Excise constable. Rest one witness has been declined by the learned A.P.P. Ext.s 1 and 1/1 are marked on behalf of the prosecution. On the other hand, defence has neither examined any witnesses nor marked any documents as exhibits on its behalf. 6. The learned defence counsel has argued that the case is falsely foisted against the accused and no such occurrence took place to which the learned APP vehemently objected. 7. On appreciation of evidence on record P.W.2, the Excise Constable has deposed that on 09.12.2001 he was performing patrolling duty at Turiberna area along with his official staffs. During patrolling duty they detected one person with a plastic jerrycane which contained 10 litres of I.D liquor. The seizure list has been admitted into evidence vide Ext.1 and his signature as Ext.1/1. The independent witness examined in this case has deposed that he does not know anything about the present case and further stated that nothing was seized in his presence. 8. The next question to be determined is whether the seizure was made from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused. To this the learned counsel for the accused submitted that the independent witness available in this case did not prove the search and seizure. The seized article was also not produced before the Court during the course of trial. The witness examined in this case is the interested witness for the prosecution as such he cannot be relied upon and accordingly, the accused be acquitted. Admittedly, the seized liquor has not been produced in the court. The witness examined is the interested witness whose evidence required corroboration by independent witness which is absent in this case. In the absence of independent corroboration, the search and seizure of the contraband articles become doubtful. No documents relating to the ownership of the house were verified from the accused. The possibility that her husband and other inmates might have possessed the same can not be ruled out in the facts of this case. When the evidence on this score is wanting, the criminal liability for the existence of the liquor can not be fastened on the accused beyond doubt. There is totally absence of evidence regarding the conscious possession of the I.D. Liquor by the accused. In view of the above discussion, the fact that the seized article was recovered from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused becomes doubtful. Hence, it is concluded that prosecution has failed to prove the factum of seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts. \n 9.  In the result, therefore, I hold the accused not guilty of committing the offence punishable U/s. 47(a) of the Bihar & Orissa Excise Act and acquit her as per S. 248(1) of the Cr.PC. The accused be set at liberty forthwith and is discharged from her bail bond. \n The seized articles, if any, be destroyed after four months of expiry of appeal period if no appeal is preferred and if preferred, be dealt with as per the direction of the Appellate Court. Enter this case as mistake of fact. Pronounced the judgment in the Open Court today i.e on 22nd day of June, 2015 under my hand and seal of the Court. \n J.M.F.C, Rourkela Typed to my dictation & corrected by me. \n J.M.F.C, Rourkela List of witnesses examined for the prosecution: P.W.1     Hari Dhanwar P.W.2     Prafulla Kumar Naik List of witness examined for the defence: N o n e List of documents admitted in evidence for the prosecution: Ext. 1    Seizure list Ext. 1/1  Signature of P.W.2 on Ext.1 List of documents admitted in evidence for the defence: N I L List of material objects admitted in evidence for the prosecution: N I L List of material objects admitted in evidence for defence: N I L J.M.F.C., Rourkela.\n ",

COMMISSIONER OF COMMERCIAL TAXES, ZONE-1, BANGALORE, SETTING ASIDE THE ORDER PASSED BY THE FIRST APPELLATE AUTHORITY AND MODIFYING THE ORDERS PASSED BY THE ASSESSING AUTHORITY. DIRECTING THE ASSESSING AUTHORITY TO CALCULATE THE TAXES PAYABLE BY THE DEALERS COMPANY AND ISSUE DEMAND NOTICE. THIS STA COMING ON FOR ADMISSION, THIS DAY, DILIP B. BHOSALE J. DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING: PC: Heard learned counsel for the parties. 2. This appeal is directed against the order dated 27.7.11 passed by the Revisional Authority namely the Additional Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Zone-1, Bangalore, whereby suo moto revision under Section 22-A(1) of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957 (for short the `KST Act') was allowed and the order passed by the Joint Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (Appeals) DVO-I & III, Bangalore (for short the \"AA\") dated 6.1.2007, passed in KST.AP.No.2/06-07 was set aside. Before the AA, the appellant had questioned the re-assessment order dated 2.3.2006 passed under Section 12-A of the KST Act for the assessment year 2000-01 passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (Transition-31), Bangalore. The Revisional Authority, set aside the order passed by the AA. The operative portion of the order passed by the Revisional Authority reads thus: \"The order passed by the First Appellate authority is set aside. The order passed by the Assessing authority is modified. The Assessing authority is directed to levy tax on the turnover of Rs.3,95,16,208-00 (exemption claimed on E.O.U sales which does not satisfy the conditions stipulated in the notification). The Assessing authority is also directed to give exemption on the turnover of Rs.12,98,151-00 as supported by declarations. \n Taxable turnover and exempted turnover in respect of the other transactions as found in the order under Section 12-A left undisturbed.  The Assessing authority is directed to calculate the taxes payable by the dealer company and issue demand notice accordingly.\"\n 3.  The appellant-dealer company is the manufacturer of furniture. The appellant claims that, during the financial year 1.4.2000 to 31.3.2001, they supplied furniture to 100% Export Oriented Units (for short the `EOU') and in view thereof, they are entitled for exemption under the Notification dated 15.11.1996 bearing No.FD 32 CSL 96(V).\n 4.   We have perused the Notification dated 15.11.96. It was issued in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 8-A of the KST Act. By this Notification, the Government of Karnataka reduced, with immediate effect, the rate of tax payable under the Act to `nil' on sales of raw materials, component parts, packing materials, consumables, capital goods, spares, materials handling equipments, intermediate and semi-finished goods and sub-assemblies by a registered dealer to 100% EOU located in the State subject to the conditions prescribed therein. \n 5.  From bare perusal of the Notification, it is clear that a dealer claiming an exemption was supposed to satisfy two conditions, firstly, he should be a registered dealer, and secondly, the purchaser of furniture should be 100% EOU located in the State. In the Notification, the registered dealer was supposed to issue Certificate in the prescribed form signed by 100% EOU. The Notification further provides that the Certificate issued by the Director of Industries and commerce, Government of Karnataka or Government of India, certifying that it is registered as a 100% EOU and that the said Certificate shall be produced, in proof of its being valid, in each assessment year, within 60 days of commencement of the assessment year. \n 6. The claim of the appellant is based on the aforementioned Notification. The appellant-company claims that during the financial year 1.4.2000 to 31.3.2001, they supplied furniture to 100% EOUs and in support thereof, they filed on record Certificates in the form of Declaration signed by the purchasers. Though such claim was made, learned counsel appearing for the respondent, on the basis of the record, submitted that no such declarations were in fact placed on record. We would not like to enter into this controversy . We specifically asked learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant whether Certificates issued by the Director of Industries and Commerce, Government of Karnataka or Government of India certifying the purchasers as 100% EOUs were filed before the authorities below, the answer was in the Negative. It was submitted that no opportunity was given to the appellant. It was further submitted that the only question, the Revisional Authority was supposed to examine, was whether the `furniture' would fall in the category of capital goods so as to claim exemption under the Notification dated 15.11.96.\n  In view thereof, on 13.9.13 we had passed the following order: \"Learned counsel for the appellant seeks time till 19.9.2013 to produce copies of the Certificates issued by the Director of Industries & Commerce, Government of Karnataka or Government of India certifying that the purchasers, to whom the appellant sold furniture, are registered as 100% Export Oriented Units (for short the `EOU'). We have noticed that Revisional Authority has not considered the question whether the `Furniture' would fall in the category of \"Capital Goods\" as contemplated by Notification dated 15.11.1996. We, make it clear that, if we are satisfied that the purchasers were having EOU Certificates, we may consider the prayer of learned counsel appearing for the appellant to remand the matter to consider the issue of \"Capital Goods\" with direction to the Revisional Authority to verify genuineness of the Certificates.\"\n        In view of the above order, learned counsel appearing for the appellant placed before us six Certificates issued in favour of the six units, to whom, the appellant had supplied Furniture during the relevant financial year. 7. Smt. Sujatha, learned AGA appearing for the respondent, on the basis of record, submitted that except M/s PSI Data Systems Limited, the names of other five purchasers of furniture, during the relevant financial year, do not appear in the list that was furnished before the authorities below. In other words, she submitted that neither the certificates issued in favour of the five purchasers are on record nor their names appear in the list of purchasers of the furniture supplied by the appellant at the relevant time. 8. Insofar as M/s. PSI Data Systems Limited is concerned, the benefit as per the Certificate was given by the Revisional Authority. Despite the opportunity given to the appellant to produce Certificates, no such Certificates of the purchasers to whom the furniture was supplied during the relevant financial year are produced before this Court. The Notification, in our opinion, make it clear that unless the purchaser-Unit is 100% EOU, the supplier of furniture, to such Unit is not entitled for exemption. Since we are satisfied on facts that the appellant is not entitled to claim exemption under the Notification, the questions of law, as raised in the memorandum of appeal, in our opinion, deserves no consideration and hence we dismiss the appeal. \n Sd/- JUDGE Sd/- JUDGE TL",

Accused persons. Counsel for the Prosecution: Sri D. Mishra,APP,Sundargarh.\n                 Counsel for the defence : Sri S K Purohit & associates. Date of Argument : 18-03-2015.\n                           Date of Judgment : 18-03-2015.\n\n    Offence U/ss 341/323/294/506/34 of the Indian Penal Code\n\n              // J U D G M E N T //  1.  The above, named accused persons, stand prosecuted for commission of offence under Sections 341/323/294/506/34 of Indian Penal Code (herein after referred to as \"the I.P.C.\"). \n 2.            The story of the prosecution, in brief, is that on dated 13.11.2009 the informant Madhusudan Chhatria appeared at Kinjirkela PS and lodged a written report alleging therein that on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM, when he was coming out of his house then the accused persons abused him in obscene words such as \" TU KI BANDAR MEMBER \" and also assaulted him as a result of which he sustained injuries on his person. Thereafter he lodged the FIR at the police station. Basing upon such report the present case was registered. The investigation of the case was started. After completion of investigation the IO submitted charge sheet U/s 341/323/294/506/34 of IPC against the accused persons to face their trial in the Court of Law. Hence this case. 3.             The plea of the deence is one of complete denial and false implication. 4. The points for determination in this case are as follows:- i)        Whether on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM , in front of the house of the informant, the accused persons in furtherance of common intention wrongfully restrained the informant Madhusudan Chhatria on his way in which he has right to proceed ? \n ii)       Whether on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM , in front of the house of informant , the accused persons in furtherance of common intention, voluntarily caused hurt to the informant Madhusudan Chhatria ? \n iii) Whether on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM, in front of the house of informant, the accused persons in furthrance of common intention abused the informant Madhusudan Chhatria in in obscene words such as \"TU KI BANDAR MEMBER \" in or near a public place causing annoyance to him and others ? ii)       Whether on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM, in front of the house of informant, the accused persons in furtherance of common intention committed criminal intimation by threatening the informant Madhusudan Chhatira to kill him in life with an intent to cause alarm to him? \n 5.      In order to substantiate its case, the prosecution has examined five witnesses, out of whom, P.W.2 is the informant of this case, P.W.1 is the doctor.\n P.W.3 Is the wife of P.W.2. P.W.4 and P.W.5 are the independent witnesses. On the other hand, no-one was examined on behalf of the defense. \n 6.                So far as the present case is concerned. P.W.2, the informant of this case deposed that he knows the accused persons who are his co-villagers. He deposed that he has lodged the FIR against the accused persons due to misunderstanding and he does not want proceed anything against the accused persons as the disputes has already been amicably settled within them outside the Court. He proved the FIR as Ext.2 and Ext.2/1 is his signature thereon. During his cross examination he deposed that he does not want to proceed further in this case and he has a good relationship with the accused persons and now they are living peacefully forgetting their differences. P.W.3 the wife of the informant deposed that she know the accused persons. She further deposed that she does not know anything about this case and her husband told her that the disputes has already been amicably settled between. Another independent witnesses who have been examined as P.W.4 and P.W.5 denied of having any knowledge regarding case matter. Though P.W.1 the doctor of this case deposed that on dated. 14.11.2009 at about 4.45 PM he had examined the informant Madhusudan Chhhatria on police requisition and prepared his injury report vide Ext.1 but the evidence of the doctor is of no avail the case of the prosecution in absence of any ocular evidence on record. \n 7.  The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused also submitted that the dispute has already been amicably settled outside the Court among themselves. So the accused persons are entitled for a clean acquittal. \n 8.  Here in this case at hand, all of the witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution have not uttered a single word implicating the accused persons in this case. Even the informant has not whispered a single word against the accused persons in this present case rather he has specifically stated that dispute has already been amicably settled between themselves. Law is well settled that FIR is not a substantive piece of evidence and no conviction can lie only on the basis of FIR without having any corroboration from the maker thereof. In the present case even if the Complaint /FIR (Ext.1) disclosed regarding the alleged incident committed by the accused persons on the alleged date of occurrence. It is of no help to the case of the prosecution in absence of any evidence available on record. \n In view of the above discussion and considering the available evidence on record, I am of the view that the prosecution has not adduced a single evidence to substantiate its charge against the accused persons , hence there is absolutely no evidence on record to implicate the accused persons in the present case. \n 9.  In the result, the accused persons found not guilty for the offence U/ss 341/323/294/506/34 of I.P.C and are acquitted therefrom as per the provision of U/s 255 (1) Cr.P.C. They be set at liberty forthwith and their bail bond be cancelled. Enter the case \"as mistake of fact\". \n J.M.F.C.,Sundargarh.

The petitioner is a registered dealer under the provisions of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 (Hereinafter referred to as the `KVAT Act', for brevity) and is engaged in the manufacture and sale of rice bran oil, cotton seed oil, sunflower oil and soya oil, by employing solvent extraction process out of rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake, and soya seeds. While oil is liable to tax and the by-product de- oiled bran and cake is exempted from tax. The petitioner claims that returns of turnover in Form VAT 100 for the tax periods April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 were filed compiled on the basis of books of accounts and the tax was paid as admitted therein. In the said returns filed, the petitioner had claimed partial input rebate in terms of section 17 of the KVAT Act in respect of rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake and soya seeds used as input in the extraction of oil on the understanding of the law while filing returns that it was not eligible for full input tax rebate. The said returns are deemed as accepted under section 38(1) of the KVAT Act. \n 3. The first respondent audited the books of account for the tax periods April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 and had passed re-assessment orders under section 39(1) of the KVAT Act levying tax, penalty and interest. In doing so, the prescribed authority had allowed the partial input rebate as per Section 17 of the KVAT Act, on the value of inputs namely, rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake and soya seed used in the extraction of oil on the understanding of law that the petitioner is not eligible for full input tax rebate. \n 4. Subsequent to the filing of the returns, a division bench of this court has rendered its judgment in M.K.Agro Tech Private Limited vs. State of Karnataka, 2014(18) KLJ 1, to the effect that when an assessee is in the business of manufacture of only one product, namely, oil and which is liable to tax, merely because in the process of manufacture of oil, certain by-product arises, which is sold and which is exempted from tax, that would not attract the provisions of Section 17 of the KVAT Act relating to partial rebate. This was the declaratory of the law and according to the petitioner, would always have been applicable to all assessments made prior to and after the date of the said judgment. Therefore, the petitioner has filed an application under Section 69(1) relating to the tax period April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 before the first respondent, for rectification of the re-assessment orders and to grant full input tax rebate on the value of VAT. That was rejected only on the ground that the petitioner ought to have made a claim for full tax rebate in the first instance and no such claim having been made would preclude it from doing so, since such a claim could have been made only within a period of six months and not beyond that and hence, the question of considering the case of the petitioner for such full tax rebate would not arise. Insofar as the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech, supra, is concerned, it is applied in favour of the assesses from the date of judgment and there can be no second opinion, though the revenue has sought to challenge the same before the apex court and is pending consideration. 5. The learned Government Advocate, while justifying the order, would submit that the question of rectification would not arise and it is a misconception on the part of the petitioner that they could file such a rectification application within a period of five years. Since the statute was clear even as on the date the claim was made and in the absence of any such claim, the petitioner now seeking to raise such a claim by hindsight, notwithstanding that it is only after the judgment was delivered by a division bench in M.K.Agro Tech, supra, in that, it has dawned on the petitioner that it could have made such an application, cannot be countenanced and seeks to contend that if any such benefit is given, the revenue would suffer serious loss. \n 6. By way of reply, the learned Senior Advocate would point out that it is unfair on the part of the revenue to contend that such a claim should have been made in the first instance and that the petitioner is precluded from raising such a claim as on date, as it was a mutually understood position of law which prevented the assessees from raising such claim. For otherwise, if such claim had been made, it was quite possible that they would have been penalized for making such a claim and it is only on the legal position being settled by a decision of a division bench of this court that the benefit available to the petitioner has dawned on the petitioner and therefore, the rectification application was justified. 7. The point for consideration would be whether the petitioner could avail the benefit of the judgment which was rendered much after the assessment order was passed and whether such reassessment orders can be passed on their prayer for rectification of the earlier assessment. \n 8. In the above circumstances, in a situation where if the revenue were to be in the position of the assessee and if it was discovered that by virtue of the operation of law, the revenue was entitled to a certain amount from the dealers, it would have certainly turned the tables on the assessee and proceeding on that presumption, it would be only just and fair to direct the revenue to consider the prayer of the petitioner for rectification, when there is no dispute that they were entitled to full tax rebate by virtue of the decision in M.K.Agro Tech, supra. It would be a formality for the respondent to pass a rectification order and grant full tax rebate to the petitioner in terms of its prayer. The petitions are allowed. The impugned orders are set aside with direction to the first respondent to redo the same and give the petitioner the full benefit of the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech, supra. \n The respondent having challenged the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech,supra, before the apex court, there is no order of stay. Therefore, having regard to the law laid down by this court, the respondents are bound to comply. \n Sd/- JUDGE nv",
