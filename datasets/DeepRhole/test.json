    "data": "The appellant is a trust which wanted to establish a self-financing Engineering College and submitted an application during 1994-95 to the University of Kerala as well as to All India Council for Technical Education (hereinafter called the 'AICTE There was an inspection by a team of Professors of the University and it recommended favourably when it stated that the facilities provided by the appellant would be sufficient for establish-ing an Engineering College The AICTE sent a communication on 30.4.1995 stating that on the basis of the observations made by the Expert Committee and the recommendations made by the Central Regional Committee,State Level Committee and Central Task Force as per the provisions of the AICTE regulation dated 30.1.1994,the AICTE was granting conditional approval for establishing an Engineering and Technical College The abovesaid approval was subject to the fulfilment of specific conditions mentioned in Annexure I and the general conditions mentioned in Annexure II to the said letter In the event of contravention of the conditions,guidelines,norms and regula-tions of the AICTE,the AICTE could withdraw the approval at any time Under the impression that the State Govt.was to grant permission,the appellant requested the State Government by letter dated 24.6.1995 for permission to start the college Meanwhile,the Mahatama Gandhi University by their letter dated 31.5.1995 forwarded to the Government a list of Colleges and Courses for affiliation during the academic year 1995-96.The appellant's college was shown as one of the colleges among the affiliated colleges for the said period The appellant sent a reminder to the Government on 26.8.1995 for permission for starting the college for the academic year 1995-96 and ultimately the Government refused permission by informing the appellant by a letter dated 16.8.1996 as follows : In inviting your attention to the reference cited,I am to inform you that Government regret their inability to comply with your request Thereafter,the appellant filed writ petition O.P.No.4612 of 1996 for quashing the said order and for a direction to sanction and establish an Engineering College The learned Single Judge of the High Court by his judgment dated 14.1.1997 allowed the writ petition,quashed the above-said order of the government dated 16.8.1996 and directed the Mahatama Gandhi University to consider the appellant's application for permanent affiliation without reference to the above letter of the Government and pass appropriate order within 8 weeks from the date of the receipt of a copy of the judgment The direction to pass a fresh order of affiliation was issued in view of the fact that the University contended before the learned Single Judge that unless the Government granted approval,permanent affiliation could not be granted The Government was also directed to reconsider its decision Against the said judgment of the learned Single Judge the Commis-sioner and Secretary of the Government (Higher Education Department) filed Writ Appeal No.1024 of 1997.The Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Government and dismissed the writ petition The Division Bench,however,observed that the appellant was at liberty to make a fresh application to the Government of Kerala for according sanction for setting up the Engineering College or to request the Government to consider the earlier application,for a future academic year It is against the abovesaid judgment of the Division Bench that this appeal has been preferred Learned senior counsel for the appellant Sri T.L.Vishwanatha Iyer contended that the Division Bench erred in reversing the well considered judgment of the learned Single Judge and according to him after the coming into force of the AICTE Act,1987,the statutes conferring power on the State or University to the extent they were inconsistent with the Central Act were void In so far as institutions imparting technical education were concerned,the University or the State Government had no independent role to play except to the extent provided in the above said enactment,in the present case,the AICTE had made inspections and was satisfied that the necessary infrastructure was available and that the appellant would be able to conform to the required standards of the education The AICTE had consulted the State of Kerala as well as the Mahatama Gandhi University The University had granted conditional approval,as stated earlier Therefore the AICTE consti-tuted a Task Force and obtained its opinion and thereafter granted its approval on 13.11.1995 subject to various conditions According to the learned senior counsel it was indeed not necessary for the appellant to have applied to the State Government for any further sanction to establish the college It might be that under the relevant statutes of the University,the University was required to obtain the \"views\" of the State Government but that did not amount to requiring any approval of the State Government and indeed if any such statute required the approval of the state Government,it would be void in view of what was stated by this Court in State of Tamil Nadu Another v Adhiyaman Educational & Research Institute Others,[l995] 4 SCC 104.1995 Indlaw SC 1631 Sri T.L.Viswanatha Iyer also contended that though the State Government stated in its counter affidavit filed in the High Court that the \"policy\" of the Government was not to grant approval to self-financing engineering colleges to be established,such a policy could not come in the way of the appellant in view of what this Court has stated in similar circumstances in Thirumuruga Kirupan & Variyar Thavathiru Sundara Swamigal Medical Education & Charitable Trust v State of Tamil Nadu & Others,[1996] 3 SCC 15 1996 Indlaw SC 858 On the other hand learned Additional Solicitor General Sri Mukul Rohtagi contended on behalf of the State of Kerala that the \"Policy\" of the State of Kerala at the relevant time was not to grant approval for establish-ment of more engineering colleges in the State The Government had clarified in the counter affidavit filed in the High Court that the Government \"was not in a position\" to take a decision to start new engineering colleges,without properly assessing the necessity of more engineering graduates from the State and without exploring the possibility of employment opportunities in the country as a whole Also there were four Engineering Colleges at Kannur,Trichur,Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram Districts and three Private (Aided) Engineering Colleges at Palakkad,Ernakulam (Kothamangalam) and Kollam Districts The Model Engineering College,Emakulam was a selffinancing Engineering College and others were the colleges at Changannur and Pathansamthitta and there was a self-financing engineering college at Kasargode There were also two unaided Engineering Colleges at Mallappuram and Thiruvananthapuram Even though the appellant trust was not seeking aid from the Government and even assuming that it was financially self-sufficient,it would not be in the interests of the students & employment,to permit new engineering colleges to be established Thus the Government policy was not to grant fresh approvals If more approvals were granted,it might lead to commercialisation of education The following points arise for consideration : (1 Whether in view of the judgment of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu & Another v Adhiyaman Educational & Research Institute & Others,[1995] 4 SCC 104 1995 Indlaw SC 1631,the provisions of the AICTE Act,1987 occupied the field and it was not necessary to obtain the further approval of the Government or other authority Whether any statute in the State of Kerala if it required such approval,would be void 2) Whether the orders of rejection passed by the State Government were valid on merits and whether the University should have granted further orders to continue the affiliation solely on the basis of the AICTE permission Point 1 This point is more or less covered by the judgment of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu But,in the context of s.10(K) regarding 'approval' for starting a technical institution,certain aspects of the judgment need to be highlighted Before we refer to the abovesaid judgment,it will be necessary to refer to certain provisions of the AICTE Act and the relevant regulations The abovesaid Act was an act to provide for the establishment of All India Council for Technical Education with a view to the proper planning and coordinated development of the technical education system throughout the country,the promotion of qualitative improvement of such education in relation to planned quantitative growth and the regulation and proper maintenance of norms and standards in the technical education system and for matters connected therewith U/s.10 of the Act,it is stated that it is the duty of the Council constituted under the Act to take all steps as the said Council might think fit for ensuring coordinated and integrated develop-ment of technical education and maintenance of standards For the purposes of performing its functions under the Act,the Council may (a) undertake survey in various fields of technical education,collect data on all related matters and make forecast of the needed growth and development in technical education; (b) coordinate the development of technical education in the country at all levels; (c) allocate and disburse out of the Fund of the Council such grants on such terms and conditions as it may think fit to (i) technical institutions,and (ii) Universities imparting technical education in coordination with the Commission; (d) promote innovations,research and development in established and new technologies,generation adoption and adaptation of new technologies to meet developmental requirements and for overall improve-ment of educational processes; (e) formulate schemes for promoting technical education for women,handicapped and weaker sections of the society; (f) promote an effective link between technical education system and other relevant systems including research and development organisations,industry and the community; (g) evolve suitable performance appraisal systems for technical institutions and Universities imparting technical education,incorpo-rating norms and mechanisms for enforcing accountability; (h) formulate schemes for the initial and in-service training of teachers and identify institutions or centres and set up new centres for offering staff development programmes including continuing education of teachers; (i) lay down norms and standards for courses,curricula,physical and instructional facilities,staff pattern,staff qualifications,quality instructions,assessment and examinations (j) fix norms and guidelines for charging tuition and other fees The clause in S.10(1) which is important in the present case is subcl.(k) of s.10(1) and it provides that the Council might \"grant approval for starting new technical institutions and for introduction of new courses or programmes in consultation with the agencies concerned Sub-cl.(1) permits the Council to advice the Central Government in certain respects,sub-cl.(m) lay down norms for granting autonomy,subcl.(n) to take necessary steps to prevent commercialisation of technical education,cl.(o) to provide guidelines for admission of students to technical institutions and Universities imparting technical education,cl.(p) to inspect or cause inspection to any technical institution,cl.(q) to withhold or discontinue grant,cl.(r) to strengthen the existing organisa-tions etc.,cl.(s) to declare technical institutions as fit to receive grants,cl.(t) to advice for declaring institutions to be deemed as universities,cl.(u) to set up a National Board of Accreditation S.11 of the Act deals with inspection Regulations have been framed on 31st October,1994 by the AICTE in exercise of powers conferred on it by s.23(1) of the AICTE Act Regulation 2 states that these regulations will be applicable to proposals relating to \"(a) grant of approval of the Council for establishment of new technical institutions including Universities or University depart-ments and deemed Universities and for technical institutions function-ing on the date of commencement of these regulations at Degree and Diploma levels; (b) grant of approval of the Council for introduction of any course or programme in the technical institutions and technical departments or Universities or deemed Universities; (c) grant of approval of the Council for existing intake capacity of seats and for increase in the annual intake capacity of seats in courses and programmes Regulation 4 deals with the requirement of grant of approval and for the commencement of these regulations \"(a b) no course or programme shall be introduced in any technical institutions,university or deemed university or university departments or college; or (c) no technical institutions,Universities or deemed Universities or University Departments or colleges shall continue to admit students for degree or diploma courses or programmes d) no approved intake capacity of seats shall be increased or varied : except with the approval of the Council Reg..4(2 Regulation 5 deals with the Forms of the Applications and Regulation 6 deals with the conditions for grant of approval,Sub-cls.1 of Regulation 6 deals with the financial position Sub-cl.2 with the courses or programmes and sub-cl.3 deals with the power of admissions and sub-cl.4 with tuition fees etc.and sub-cl.5 with the staff and sub-cl.6 with the Governing Body of the private institutions and subcl.7 with other matters Regulation 8 deals with scrutiny of applications There is a prelimi-nary scrutiny of the applications by the Bureau RC of the Council Sub-cl.4 of Regulation 8 reads as follows Reg.8(4 The Bureau RC shall invite comments/recommendations on the applications referred to in sub-regulation (3) from the follow-ing,namely i) the State Government concerned ; (ii) the affiliating University/State Board of Technical Education; (iii) Bureaus MPCD; (iv) Bureau BOS; (v) Bureau RA; (vi) the Regional Office Sub-cl.5 of Regulation 8 requires the Regional Office to arrange visits by an Expert Committee constituted by the Council which is to forward its recommendations to the Council Sub-cl.6 of Regulation 8 states that the State Level Committee constituted under Regulation 9(4) is to consider the recommendations of the State Government and others mentioned in regulation 8(4) and that it is to make its recommendations to the Central Task Force constituted under regulation 9(5) and consider the recommendations of the State Level Committee and send its recommendations to the Member Secretary of the Council Sub-cls.8 9 of Regulation 8 are important and read as follows : \"Reg.8(8) If there is a disagreement in the recommendations made by the State Government,University or the Regional Committee,the Central Task Force shall invite representatives of the respective agencies for further consultations before making final recommenda-tion; (9 On the recommendation of the Central Task Force,the Council shall decide the question of grant of approval as sought for in the application Provided that the Council may,for reasons to be communicated to the applicant,allow the approval with such restrictions or modifications as it may deem necessary Sub-cl.10 of Regulation 8 states that the decision of the Council shall be communicated to the State Government concerned or the UGC,as the case may be,the concerned University or the State Board,the Regional Office and the applicant before 30th April in case the application was made before the preceding 31st December The Tamil Nadu case As stated earlier,the above provisions of the AICTE Act,came up for consideration in State of Tamil Nadu v Adhiyaman Educational & Research Institute,[1995] 4 SCC 104 1995 Indlaw SC 1631 In the above matter,the State of Tamil Nadu granted permission on 17.4.84 to all private managements to start private Engineering colleges without financial commitment to government but subject to conditions At that time in 1984,the AICTE Act was not on the statute book The Government of Tamil Nadu granted permission to the Trust for the academic year 1987-88 to start an Engineering college The University also granted permission on 21.11.87 for the academic year 1987 88.Later on,these permissions were withdrawn by the State after issuing show cause on 16.7.89.So did the University on 26.7.89.But by that date,the AICTE Act,1987 had come into force The learned Single Judge and the Division Bench held in favour of the Trust and quashed and orders of the Government and the University The said judgments were affirmed by this Court It was held that the AICTE Act was referable to Entry 66,List I of the Constitution of India,relating to \"coordination and determination of standards in institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical institutions\".After the Constitutional Amendment (42 Amendment Act,1976) Entry 25 of List III in the Concurrent List read : \"Education,included technical education,medical institution and Universities,subject to the provisions of Entries 63,64,65 and 66 of List I; vocational and technical training of labour\".Thus,the State law under Entry 23 of List III would be repugnant to any law made by the Parliament under Entry 66 of List I,to the extent of inconsistency The Tamil Nadu Act was of 1976 and the University Act was of 1923 and were laws referable to the List III.Whether they were preconstitutional or a post constitutional laws,they would be repugnant to the AICTE Act passed by Parliament under Entry 66 of List I.In the above case this Court referred to the various provisions of the AICTE Act and on the question of repugnancy held as follows Hence on the subjects covered by the statute,the State could not make a law under Entry 25 of List III after the Forty-Second Amendment If there was any such existing law immediately before the commencement of the Constitution within the meaning of Art.372 of the Constitution,as the Madras University Act 1923 on the enactment of the present Central Act,the provisions of the said law if repugnant to the provisions of the Central Act would stand impliedly repealed to the extent of repugnancy Such repugnancy would have to be adjudged on the basis of the tests which are applied for adjudging repugnancy u/art.254 of the Constitution We shall now refer to the above judgment dealing with the question of 'approval' for establishing technical institutions under s.10(K) of the AICTE Act The Tamil Nadu Rules of 1976 made under the 1976 Act had no doubt excluded technical institutions from the purview of the Rules but this Court pointed out that the Rules were capable of being amended so as to extend to such technical institutions and that if they were so extended,the State Act of 1976 and the Rules would require \"approval' by the State Government and that would be void It was stated that inasmuch as the State Act, \"will overlap and will be in conflict with the provisions of the Central Act in various areas granting approval for starting new technical institution inspection of technical institution ............which are matters covered by the Central Act This Court then referred to the Madras University Act,1923.It was held that s.10 of the Central Act dealt with various matters (including granting approval for starting new technical institutions),and that so far as these matters were concerned it is not the University Act and the University but it is the Central Act and the Council created under it which will have the jurisdiction To that extent,after the coming into force of the Central Act,the provisions of the University Act will be deemed to have become unenforceable Thus,in the two passages set out above,this Court clearly held that because of s.10(k) of the Central Act which vested the powers of granting approval in the Council,the T.N.Act of 1976 and the University Act,1923 could not deal with any questions of 'approval' for establishment of technical institutions All that was necessary was that under the Regulations,the AICTE Council had to consult them Statutory powers of the State of Kerala and the M.G.University The question is as to how far the judgment in the Tamil Nadu case is to be applied in the State of Kerala Learned Additional Solicitor General stated before us that there was no statute in the State of Kerala corresponding to the Tamil Nadu Act of 1976 nor any other law which specifically required the 'approval' of the State Government It was however contended that the Tamil Nadu case was concerned only with the standards of education and as to who could fix them We are not inclined to agree We have already pointed out under Point 1 that in the Tamil Nadu case,s.10(k) of the AICTE Act was referred to and the power of 'approval' for establishing a technical institution was considered,in our opinion,even if there was a State law in the State of Kerala which required the approval of the State Government for establishing technical institutions,such a law would have been repugnant to the AICTE Act and void to that extent,as held in the Tamil Nadu case The only provision relied on before us by the State Government which according to its learned senior counsel,amounted to a statutory requirement of 'approval' of the State Government,was the one contained in cl.9(7) of the Kerala University First Statute It reads as follows : \" Grant of affiliation : (1 After considering the report of the Commission and the report of the local inquiry,if any,and after making such further inquiry as it may deem necessary,the Syndicate shall decide,after ascer-taining the view of the Government also,whether the affiliation be granted or refused,either in whole or part In case affiliation is granted,the fact shall be reported to the Senate at its next meet-ing It will be noticed that cl.9(7) of the statute required that before the University took a decision on \"affiliation\",it had to ascertain the \"views\" of the State Government The reference to the Commission in the above cl.9(7) is to the Commission of Inspection appointed by the University Sub-cl.(1) of cl.(9) of the statute required \"verification of the facilities that may exist for starting the new colleges/course\".The Commission was to inspect the site,verify the title deeds as regards the proprietary right of the management over the land (and buildings,if any) offered,building accommodation provided,if any,assets of the management,constitution of the registered body and all other relevant matters,Sub-cl.(2) of cl.(9) stated that the affiliation \"shall depend upon the fulfilment by the management of all the conditions for the satisfactory establishment and maintenance of the proposed institutional courses of studies and on the reports of inspection by the Commission or Commissions which the University may appoint for the purpose As held in the Tamil Nadu case,the Central Act of 1987 and in particular,s.10(k) occupied the field relating the 'grant of approvals' for establishing technical institutions and the provisions of the Central Act alone were to be complied with So far as the provisions of the Mahatma Gandhi University Act or its statutes were concerned and in particular statute 9(7),they merely required the University to obtain the 'views' of the State Government That could not be characterised as requiring the \"approval' of the State Government If,indeed,the University statute could be so inter-preted,such a provision requiring approval of the State Government would be repugnant to the provisions of s.10(k) of the AICTE Act,1987 and would again be void As pointed out in the Tamil Nadu case there were enough provisions in the Central Act for consultation by the Council of the AICTE with various agencies,including the State Governments and the Universities concerned The State Level Committee and the Central Regional Committees contained various experts and State representatives In case of difference of opinion as between the various consultees,the AICTE would have to go by the views of the Central Task Force These were sufficient safeguards for ascertaining the views of the State Governments and the Universities No doubt the question of affiliation was a different matter and was not covered by the Central Act but in the Tamil Nadu case,it was held that the University could not impose any conditions inconsistent with the AICTE Act or its Regulation or the conditions imposed by the AICTE.Therefore,the procedure for obtaining the affiliation and any conditions which could be imposed by the University,could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Central Act The University could not,therefore,in any event have sought for 'approval' of the State Government Thus we hold,in the present case that there was no statutory require-ment for obtaining the approval of the State Government and even if there was one,it would have been repugnant to the AICTE Act The University statute 9(7) merely required that the 'views' of the State Government be obtained before granting affiliation and this did not amount to obtaining 'approval'.If the University statute required 'approval',it would have been repugnant to the AICTE Act Point 1 is decided accordingly Point 2 Factual position and pleadings in this case On facts,the position was that the AICTE had granted approval on 30.4.95 expressly stating that this was \"on consideration of the observations made by the Expert Committee and the recommendations made by the Central Regional Committee,State Level Committee,Central Task Force as per the provisions of AICTE Regulations dated 31.10.94\".The AICTE had granted condition approval and the conditions were specified in Annexure I to the order and the general conditions were enlisted in Annexure II.The State Government was directed by the AICTE to announce admission in accordance with Regulation notified on 20.5.94 and based on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Unnikrishnan v State of Andhra Pradesh,[1993] 1 SCC 645 1993 Indlaw SC 1168.The Mahatma Gandhi University had included this appellant in the list of colleges and courses which were granted affiliation during 1995-96 and the University had written to the State Government on 31.5.95 that as per statute 9(7),the \"views\" of the government were to be sent before granting affili-ation The letter said that for that reason the proposals of the University were being submitted to the Government \"for necessary action\".The appellant had sent a reminder on 26.8.95.The State in its letter dated 16.8.96 to the appellant merely stated \"that government regret their inability to comply with your request\".No reasons were assigned in the said letter But the State in its counter filed in the High Court tried to explain that the Director of Technical Education had opined that during the year 1995-96,it might not be practicable to start the college for the Director could not ascertain the details of the facilities available It was stated : \"he could not ascertain the infrastructural facilities provided by the appellant as per the norms prescribed by the All India Council of Technical Education The All India Council for Technical Education and the Mahatma Gandhi University have sought for the remarks of the State Government Para 4 of the Counter affidavit had further stated that the Government was not \"in a position to take a decision to start new Engineering college without properly assessing the necessity of more engineering gradu-ates in the State and exploring the possibility of employment oppor-tunity in the country to the extent possible The State Government in its counter then gave the names of the existing colleges and their location We have already referred to these details It also observed that there was widespread student prospects against starting new colleges and it was necessary to be cautious in the matter of starting new engineering colleges It was stated that Government could not initially take a decision on the appellant's affiliation because of elections and that matter being one of 'major policy' the Government had subsequently \"taken a policy decision not to sanction any affiliation to such colleges either in the private sector or in the public sector for this year\".These are stated to be the reasons for the government's rejection by letter dated 16.8.96 State Government's refusal to grant permission is illegal and void on merits As already stated,in view of the judgment of this Court in Tamil Nadu case,it is obvious that there is no need to approach the State of Kerala for its approval for starting the Engineering colleges There is no power vested in the State under any State Law to grant approval and even if it was so vested,it would have been void in view of Tamil Nadu case This ground of repugnancy alone would be sufficient to quash the State Government's letter dated 16.8.1996 refusing to give their approval Even on merits,the reasons given by the State Government in its counter are not tenable in law The Director of Technical Education of the State was a member of the State Level Committee as per regulation 9(4) of the AICTE Regulations The Secretary,Technical Education of the State of Kerala was also a member of that Committee The AICTE's approval dated 30.4.95 showed that the approval had been given by the State Level Com-mittee of which they were obviously members It is,therefore,not under-standable how the Director had given a contrary opinion to the State Government Regulation 8(4) of AICTE only required calling for the \"com-ments/recommendations\" of the State Government and of the University In case,there was difference between the State Government,University or the Regional Committee the Central Task Force was to make a final recommen-dation under Regulation 8(4).Here the letter of approval of the AICTE dated 30.4.95 showed that the Central Task Force had given its approval The said approval was based also on the inspection by the Expert Committee of the AICTE.Hence the State Government in its counter,could not have relied upon any contrary opinion of the Director of Technical Education If the State Government had any other valid objections,its only remedy was to place its objections before the AICTE Council under the AICTE Act or before the Committees,e.g State Level Committee etc The so called 'policy' of the State as mentioned in the counter affidavit filed in the High Court was not a ground for refusing approval In Thirwnuruga Kirupan and Variyar Thavathiru Sundara Swamigal Medical Education & Charitable Trust v State of Tamil Nadu & Others,[1996] 3 SCC 15 1996 Indlaw SC 858,which was a case relating to Medical Education and which also related to the effect of a Central Law upon a law made by the State under Entry 25 List III,it was held that the \"essentiality certificate cannot be withheld by the State Government on any policy consideration because the policy in the matter of establishment of a new medical college now vests with the Central Government alone Therefore,the State could not have any \"policy\" outside the AICTE Act and indeed if it had a policy,it should have placed the same before the AICTE and that too before the latter granted permission Once that procedure laid down in the AICTE Act and regulations had been followed under Regulation 8(4),and the Central Task Force had also given its favourable recommendations,there was no scope for any further objection or approval by the State We may however add that if thereafter,any fresh facts came to light after an approval was granted by the AICTE or if the State felt that some conditions attached to the permission and required by the AICTE to be complied with,were not complied with,then the State government could always write to the AICTE,to enable the latter to take appropriate action Decision of University in not granting further or fined affiliation wrong on merits Admittedly,the University's inspection report was in favour of the appellant This is clear from the appellant's letter dated 31.5.95 to the State Government The only requirement as per the statute 9(7) was for the University to obtain the \"views\" of the State Government Obtaining the 'views' of the State Government,as already stated,did not amount to obtaining its 'approval'.Procedure and conditions for affiliation could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Central Act,in particular s.10(k) of the Regulation,and the University could not seek approval of Government The University was also one of the agencies consulted by the council of the AICTE under Regulation 8.Once that was over,and approval was granted by the AICTE,if there was any default on the part of the College in compliance with the conditions of approval,the only remedy for the Univer-sity was to bring those facts to the notice of the AICTE so that the latter could take appropriate action Reliance for the respondent was placed upon the subsequent report of the Syndicate dated 7.8.97.This report no doubt pointed out that the appellant had not complied with certain conditions mentioned in the approval dated 30.4.95 granted by the AICTE.Assuming certain fresh facts had come to the notice of the University,it could only place the said facts before the AICTE Thus,the University ought to have considered the grant of final or further affiliation without waiting for any approval from the State Govern-ment and should have acted on the basis of the permission granted by AICTE and other relevant factors in the University Act or statutes,which are not inconsistent with the AICTE Act or its Regulations For the aforesaid reasons,we set aside the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court and uphold the reasoning of the learned Single Judge in his judgment in OP 4612/96 dated 14.1.1997.We hold that the approval of the AICTE was sufficient,we do not also think that it was necessary for the learned Single Judge to direct the State Government to reconsider its decision The learned Single Judge's order quashing the letter of the State Government dated 16.8.96 is upheld The direction to the Mahatama Gandhi University to consider the application of the appellant for final affiliation or continuance of affiliation is confirmed and this is to be done on the basis of the approval granted by the AICTE dated 30.4.95,or any other relevant factors in the University Act or its statutes,which are not inconsistent with the AICTE Act or its Regulations The appeal is allowed and disposed of as stated above There will be no order as to costs M.JAGANNADHA RAO,J The petitioner was not a party in the High Court of Kerala and this Special Leave Petition was filed with leave of this Court We find that the petitioner has already filed a Writ Petition in the Delhi High Court namely CWP No.952 of 1998 and the same is pending It will be for the petitioner to have the said matter disposed of by the High Court of Delhi Therefore,this special leave petition is dismissed as premature Appeal allowed",

    "data": "We have heard learned counsel on both sides The admitted facts are that the respondents through their agents had registered trade mark \"Raleigh\" and other trade marks (12 marks) under the Indian Merchandise Marks Act,1889 (4 of 1989) and the Trade Marks Act,1940 (5 of 1940).The Trade and Merchandise Marks Act,1958 (43 of 1958) (for short,the 'Act) which came into force with effect from October 3,1958 has repealed the Predecessor Act and now the Act is in operation The respondents entered into an agreement with Sudhir Kumar Sen on November 3,1948 to render technical know-how to the Indian Company to be formed which would manufacture bicycles and market them under Raleigh's Indian Trade marks Pursuant thereto,a company called Sen Raleigh Limited came into existence which manufactured cycles with technical assistance by the respondents-Raleigh Industries of U.K.and marketed the bicycles with a brand name and trade marks belonging to the respondents On April 24,1954,Sen Raleigh was recorded as permitted users of the trade marks By agreement dated December 29,1962,Sen Raleigh and the respondents agreed that Sen Raleigh was registered user for further period up to 1976.Sen Raleigh was taken over by the Government of India on September 8,1975 under the IDR Act and the Government took over the management of Sen Raleigh Limited The agreement dated December 29,1962 was modified and the respondents were given option to terminate the agreement An agreement dated December 20,1976 was entered into between the appellant,as registered user and the respondent in respect of 12 trade marks for a period of 5 years On March 28,1978,joint application by Sen Raleigh and the appellant duly signed by the respondent as proprietor and Sen Raleigh Limited as registered user came to be made before the Registrar of Trade Marks On October 24,1980,Sen Raleigh was nationalized and got vested in the appellant-Corporation by publication of the notification under IDR Act On March 5,1982,the respondent wrote a letter to the appellant that in the absence of a new agreement they were instructing their advocate to prevent the appellant by restraint proceedings to use the trade mark effective from April 1,1982 On March 24,1982,the appellant made an application under Sections 32,46 and 56 of the Act against the respondents in the High Court of Calcutta in Suit No.266/92 pleading,inter alia,that the respondents had failed to provide technical assistance by passing the technical know-how to Sen Raleigh after November 1,1976.Neither the appellant nor Sen Raleigh were registered users of the trade mark after November 1,1976 u/s.48(2) of the Act up to the date of one month before filing that rectification application A continuous period of 5 years or longer had passed and the trade mark had not been bona fide used by the respondent Having regard to the extended nature of non-user of the concerned trade mark after November 1,1976,any further use of the said trade marks by the respondents was likely to deceive and cause confusion to the trade and public alike in India etc Simultaneously,an application for registration of three trade marks An their favour was filed by the appellant on March 25,1982 By proceedings dated June 13,1984,the Registrar of Trade Marks informed the appellant that the registered user's applications were abandoned since the appellant failed to comply with the statutory requirements The learned single Judge dismissed the application by his judgment dated September 13,1990 holding,inter alia,that any proprietor mentioned in S.46(1)(b) of the Act extends to bona fide user other than registered users Special circumstances as a defense were available to the respondent for non-user; even after 1979,the supply-technical know-how by the respondent was not totally absent After termination of the collaboration and user agreement between the appellant and the respondents it was likely to cause confusion and deception amongst the trade and public The conduct of the respondents was not violative of S.32(b) and (c).The Court in those circumstances declined to rectify the trade mark and strike it off from the register of trade marks On appeal,the Division Bench in Appeal No.13/91 confirmed the same holding that on and from October 25,1980,the respondent had allowed and permitted the appellant to manufacture bicycles etc.according its specifications and to pass off the goods under their trade marks Though the collaboration and registered user agreements stood expired from October 31,1981,no agreement came to be executes nor continued to use the specifications on technical know-how There is no specific bar for an unregistered lincesee to use registered trade mark so long as there is a connection in the course of trade between the licenser and the lincesee The appellant was unable to prove that there had been no such user of the trade mark for a continuous period of 61 months or longer and the lack of bona fide intention The expression \"by any registered proprietors in S.46(1)(b) should not be restricted to user by proprietor or registered user who should also include bona fide or authorized users The legislature did not intend to register proprietor to be deprived of their property at the instance of user whose use is unregistered The expression,therefore,should not be restricted to user by the proprietor himself or any registered user but should also take into account bona fide authorized user Non registration of the user agreement by Sen Raleigh and the appellant was due to the default of the latter The appellant had not taken any steps to withdraw registered user applications and as such should not be permitted to take such a contradictory stand of applying for rectification at the same time The power u/s.46 is discretionary In view of the appellant's conduct,it was taking advantage of its own wrong The discretion,therefore,was not to be extended in favour of the appellant Thus,this appeal by special leave Shri Raju Ramchandran,learned senior counsel for the appellant,raised three-fold contentions It is his pivotal contention that undisputedly when the respondent was not in urge of trade mark as \"a registered proprietor\" or its agent Sen Raleigh as Permitted user\" for a period of 5 years immediately preceding the date of the application u/s.46 for removal of the trade mark from the Register,there was no bona fide user thereof in relation to those goods by the proprietor himself The respondents admittedly did not use the same The appellant cannot be said to be either the proprietor of the trade mark since 1976,since the agreement lapsed or permitted user-.The High Court therefore was wrong in holding that 5 years' period had not lapsed The harmonious construction should be put up in such a way that S.48(2) and S.466 by of the Act could be permitted to have their-full play in their operational structure The construction put up by the High Court renders sub-s.(2) of S.48 otiose or surplus age which interpretation is impermissible It is contended that the registered user must be understood to be the user by the proprietor or authorized user registered under Section 48.The period of 5 years should be computed from that date of expiry of registered user The Division Bench,therefore,was wrong in its conclusion that the appellant has failed to establish it On the other hand,it is for the respondent to prove the same He further contended that the special circumstances enumerated in sub-s.(3) of S.46 must be such that the respondents had intended to use the registered trade mark For over a long period,the trade mark was not used by the respondents as its registered proprietor The respondents did not prove that they were prevented to use the same for 5 years or more preceding the date of the application The burden is on tile respondents to prove that non-user was due to special circumstance of the trade and not due to some other cause which would have operated whether special circumstances had arisen or not Since the respondents were not using the trade mark since April 20,1954,the plea of special circumstances is not available to the respondents The Division Bench or the learned single Judge did not record any finding as to the period up to which the bicycles could be imported into India and the period during which the ban was imposed but for which the respondent had an intention to import bicycles but were prevented to do so due to the ban In the absence of .such a findings the High Court was wrong in law in refusing to rectify the trade mark and striking it off the register The Court while exercising its discretion u/s.46 should look into not only commercial interest of the parties but also public interest In normal circumstances,when it is established that the trade mark was not used either by the registered proprietor or the permitted user,the public interest of supply of the quality of the goods marketed by the appellant should be taken into factual consideration for removal of the trade mark from the register Shri Ashok Desai,learned senior counsel for respondents,resisted the contentions According to the learned counsel,the respondents have collaboration agreement with Sen Raleigh which was taken over by the Government under IDR Act and the appellant came to manufacture,with the technical know-how supplied by the respondents,the Raleigh bicycles under the trade mark registered by the respondents in the register of the Registrar under the Act The appellant was using the same as an agent The operation of S.48(2) must be construed in such a way that the bona fide user even by a non-registered user,so long as there exist a rational connection between the proprietor of the trade mark and passes off the goods in the market manufactured by the appellant,is construed to be a bona fide user for and on behalf of the registered proprietor,namely,the respondents Admitted position is that the respondent being the registered proprietor,until it is proved that its trade mark was not used to pass off the goods manufactured by the appellant and that the appellant had discontinued the user and 5 years lapsed thereafter,the non-use of the trade mark continues thereafter,the rectification application u/s.46 (1)(b) would be ordered In view of the prohibition to import bicycles,the respondent was prevented to use the trade mark but by collaboration agreement,it was continuing to use the trade mark by the permitted user The special circumstance is that the appellant filed an application for registration u/s.48(1) and continued it till it was abandoned It would also be considered as a special circumstance for non user The discretion exercised by the Court must be judged in the light of the facts and circumstances,The appellant having used the trade mark,it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant to contend that he is not a permitted user or a bona fide user of the trade mark In view of the diverse contentions,the question arises: whether the High Court was right in refusing to rectify and strike off the trade marks of the respondents from the register of trade marks S.46(1)(b) reads as under 46.Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use.-(1 Subject to the provisions of section 47,a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either - (a) xxx xxx xxx xxx (b) that up to a date of one month before the date of the application,a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being Sub-s.(3) envisages that \"an application shall not be entitled to rely for the purpose of clause (b) of sub-s.(1) or for purpose of sub-s.(2) on any non-use of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade and not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the application relates\".S.48 provides for registered users which reads thus: '48.Registered users.-(1) Subject to the provisions of section 49,a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as the registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered otherwise than as a defensive trade mark; but the Central Government may,by rules made in this behalf,provide that no application for registration as such shall be entertained unless the agreement between the parties complies with the conditions laid down in the rules for preventing trafficking in trade marks.(2) permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be use by the proprietor thereof.and shall be used by a person the proprietor.for the purpose of s.46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law It would,thus,be apparent that subject to section 46,for a registered trade mark up to date within one month before the date of making application for rectification for a continuous period of 5 years or longer if registered trade mark had not been use during that period,there was no bona fide user in relation to those goods by the proprietor thereof for the time being The trade mark should be taken off and struck out form the register of trade marks in respect of any goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered .Sub-s.(3) enables the registered proprietor to show special circumstances for the non use of the trade mark due to which circumstances in the trade,he could not use the trade mark for the above period and not with any intention to abandon the use of trade mark or not to use the trade mark in relation to good to which the application for rectification relates Sub-s.(2) of S.48 give defence to \"permitted user\" in relation to a registered trade mark It means the use of the trade mark by a registered user of the trade mark in relation to good with which he is connected in the course of trade and in respect of which the trade mark remains registered for the time being and for which he is registered as a registered user and which complies with any conditions or restrictions to which the registration of the trade marks is subjected to S.48 (1) envisages that subject to the provisions of Section 49,a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as a \"registered user\" thereof in respect of any or all of the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered otherwise than as defensive trade mark The permitted use of trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof and shall be deemed no to be used by a person other than the proprietor for the purpose of S.46 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under the Act or any other law The Central Government is empowered to prevent trafficking in trade mark It would,therefore,be clear that a permitted use of the trade mark should be done under sub-s.(1) of Section 48.It Should be either by the registered proprietor of the trade mark or a person other than the registered proprietor registered u/s.48(1) to use the trade mark by operation of sub-section (2).An un-registered person u/s.48(1) or a person who did not register u/s.(1) of S.48 shall not be deemed to be a registered user for the purpose of S.46 or any other law The High Court recorded a finding and it is not disputed across the bar,that the appellant had entered into an agreement with Sen Raleigh which was a permitted user and used the trade mark till November 1,1976 and thereafter by registered user agreement dated December 20,1976 used trade mark for a period of 5 years It is not in dispute that till date of filing of the application,the appellant used the trade mark in passing off the bicycles under the trade mark of the respondent The question,therefore,is: whether the appellant must be deemed to be bona fide user of the trade mark,though there was no agreement nor was it registered as permitted user u/s.48(1 on admitted position and in the facts and circumstances,we are of the view that the appellant was a ago user of the trade mark of the respondent in passing off the bicycles under the trade mark of the respondent who,admittedly,is a registered proprietor It is true,as held by this Court,that to get a trade mark registered without any intention to use it in relation to any goods but merely to make money out of it by selling it to others,the right to use it as a commodity would be trafficking in that trade mark It requires to be prevented and prohibited The Court would not lend assistance to such registered proprietors of the trade mark There must be real trade connection between the proprietor of the trade and licensee of the goods and the intention to use the trade mark must exist at the date of the application for registration of trade mark and such intention must be genuine and bona fide and continue to subsist in order to disprove the charge of trafficking in trade mark It is a question of fact in every case The question is: whether the trade connection exists to dispel the charge of trafficking in the trade mark This question was considered by this Court in American Home Products Corporation vs Mac Laboratories Pvt.Ltd and Anr.1985 Indlaw SC 464 and they need no reiteration It is seen that preceding the nationalization of the Cycle manufacturing industry under the IDR Act,the respondent had a collaboration agreement with Sen Raliegh who was a registered user under Section 48.From him,the appellant came to succeed by statutory operation It was,therefore,not a case of getting the trade mark registered under the Predecessor Act and continuing under the Act for trafficking of the trade mark It is true that u/s.43(1) either the registered proprietor or a permitted person is required to register as permitted user The benefit of S.46 would be available during the period for which the agreement registered and user continued in furtherance thereof It appears that even an unregistered licensee,so long as there is unbroken Connection in the course of the trade between the licensor and the passing off lincesee's goods under the trade mark,there would be sufficient connection in the course of the trade between the proprietor and bona fide user of the trade mark by unregistered user It must,therefore,be held that though the deemed presumption under sub-s.(2) of S.48 is referable to the permitted user or the registered user and it does not extend to unregistered permitted user,the Connecting link of passing off the goods between the licensor's trade mark and the lincesee should bona fide be with the permission or Consent which may be express or implied by long course of dealings It would connect the registered proprietor and the user of the trade mark by the unregistered lincesee The appellant must be presumed by course of conduct that he is a bona fide user for the purpose of S.46(1)(b In K.R Beri and Co.vs The Metal Godds Mfg Co Pvt Limited and Anr AIR 1980 Delhi 299 1980 Indlaw DEL 180],the Division Bench construed S.48(2) and held that an unregistered user of the trade mark even With the consent of the proprietor cannot be construed to be a registered user u/s.48(1) and such construction renders sub-s.(2) of S.48 surplus age or otios,which is impermissible by statutory construction We have given anxious consideration to the reasoning therein On strict interpretation,the view of the Division Bench may be correct but it is not correct to hold that by a bona fide user of an unregistered user when connection between the proprietor of the trade mark and the permitted user in relation to passing off the goods under the trade mark are proved,it does not render sub-section (2) of S.48 surplus age or otios It is true that the burden flies on the registered proprietor of the trade mark to establish the exceptions provided under S.46(3).Equally,the applicant for rectification also prima facie shows non-user for the relevant period Then the burden shifts to the proprietor of the trade mark to affirmatively prove the special Circumstances for non-user of trade mark It must be shown that the non-use of the trade mark is due to special circumstances of the trade and not due to some other Cause which would have operated,whether the special Circumstances had arisen off not Although the special circumstances of trade taken by themselves would have prevented the use of the trade mark If the non-user was,in fact,due to some other circumstances and would have occured whether the circumstances had followed or not,subs.(3) would not apply It must,therefore,be duty of the registered proprietor to show What non-user was strictly due to the special circumstances of trade and not of any intention on the part of the registered proprietor not to use the trade mark during the relevant period Though there was a ban on impart of the Raleigh cycles manufactured outside India and passed off under the registered mark of the respondents as a registered proprietor,the circumstances do not attracted sub-section (3) of S.46 to relieve the respondents to establish non-user,but on the facts of this case,we have the admitted position that Sen Raleigh,admittedly,was a registered user through which the appellant had bona fide used the registered trade mark of the registered proprietor There is no discontinuance or non-use of the trade mark by the respondent to establish the special circumstances in this case It is also not necessary to go into the question whether the application filed by the appellant u/s.48(1) and its pendency would be a special circumstance in favour of the respondent Suffice it to hold that subs.(3) of S.46 is not attracted to the facts in this case The question then is: whether the discretion has been properly exercised by both the Division Bench as well the single Judge in refusing to take off the trade mark from the register by striking off trade mark from the register of the Registrar of Trade Marks It is true that while exercising discretion,the Court u/s.46 of the Act should take into consideration not only commercial interest of the parties but also public interest: In para 21.82 at page 386 of the law of Trade Marks and passing-off by P.Narayanan (4th Ed.),it is stated that the Court or the Registrar has discretion in granting or refusing an application for rectification Ordinarily,however,the mark will be expunged (taken off) when the factual circumstances necessary for the removal are established unless it is shown that the case comes within the exceptions provided in the sub-section (3).The High Court refused to exercise the discretion to strike off the trade mark from the register It is seen that the appellant had not abandoned,at any point of time,the use of the trade mark of the respondent-registered proprietor till filing of the application Though the appellant has not used the trade mark by itself since 1954 and after the expiry of the permitted use by Sen Raleigh until the notice was issued by the respondent directing the appellant not to use the trade mark,the appellant came to use the same in passing off bicycles manufactured by it under trade mark of the respondent It is not relevant for the purpose of S.46(1)(b) whether the bicycles were manufactured with the assistance of technical know-how passed on by Sen Raleigh or the permitted user Suffice it to state that the appellant,as a fact,had used the trade mark of the respondent in passing off the bicycles manufactured by it The High Court,in our view,declined,for good reasons,to rectify the trade mark under Section Act b) of the Act We are also not persuaded to take a different view from that of the High Court In these circumstances,we are of the view that the High Court has properly exercised its discretion and refused to rectify and strike off the trade mark,from the register of trade marks of the Registrar The appeal is accordingly dismissed but,in the circumstances,without costs",

    "data": "These appeals are directed against a judgment and order dated 17.October.2003 passed by the Special Court constituted under the Special Courts (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities Act, 1992 (for short \"the Act\") in Misc Application Nos 41 of 1999, 4 of 2001, 265, 266 and 275 of 2003 BACKGROUND FACTS The Appellants herein who are related to one Harshad S. Mehta (since deceased) purchased nine residential flats in a building called Madhuli Apartments in Worli area of Mumbai The family of the Appellants consists of four brothers, their wives, children and their widowed mother The eldest among them, Harshad S. Mehta, has since expired The said nine flats, it is said, were merged and redesigned for joint living of the entire family The Appellants herein and the said late Harshad Mehta were persons notified in terms of the Act which was enacted to provide for the establishment of a Special Court for the trial of offences relating to transactions in securities and for matters connected therewith In terms of the provisions of the Act, along with late Harshad Mehta, the Custodian had notified 29 entities in terms of S. 3 of the Act, comprising three of his younger brothers, wife of late Harshad Mehta, wives of two of his younger brothers and other corporate entities, a partnership firm and three HUFs However, out of the said 29 entitles, only Late Harshad Mehta and two of his younger brothers were cited as accused in various criminal cases filed against them The properties of Late Harshad Mehta and the Appellants, herein being notified persons stood attached in terms of the provisions of the Act PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE SPECIAL COURT Before the learned Special Court, the parties herein filed several applications which can be sub-divided in three categories, as would be noticed shortly hereinafter It is not in dispute that the learned Special Court on or about 3.August.1993 issued directions in various proceedings before it appointing auditors to prepare and audit the books of accounts of all notified persons for the period 1.April.1990 and 8.June.1992, i.e., the date of the notification Three firms of Chartered Accountants were appointed to prepare statement of accounts and liabilities of each of the Appellants, herein A Chartered Accountants' Firm was appointed by the learned Special Judge by an order dated 17.September.2003 to represent all notified entities in the family of late Harshad Mehta for the purpose of ascertaining their tax liabilities We may, at this juncture, notice the nature of the applications filed by the parties, herein before the learned Special Court: (i On 26.April.1999, the Custodian filed an application being Misc Application No. 41 of 1999 seeking permission of the Special Court for sale of residential premises commonly known as Madhuli of eight notified entities ii A Misc Application being 4 of 2001 was filed by the Custodian praying for the sale of commercial premises iii The Appellants herein filed several Misc Applications praying for lifting of attachment on their residential premises on the ground that the same had been purchased much prior to 1.April.1991 and the same had no nexus with any illegal transactions in securities Alternatively, it was prayed that since their asset base was greater than genuine liabilities, the said residential premises should be released from attachment IMPUGNED JUDGMENT By reason of the impugned order dated 17.October.2003, the learned Special Judge allowed Misc Applications Nos 4 of 2001 and 41 of 1999 The Misc Applications filed by the Appellants herein for release of the residential flats as well as the commercial premises from attachment were dismissed It was directed: \"In case, all adult members of the family of late Shri Harshad Metha, who are presently occupying the abovereferred flats, file an undertaking in this Court within a period of four weeks from today undertaking to vacate the flat occupied by them and hand over peaceful possession thereof to the custodian within a period of four weeks from the date on which the custodian sends them communication asking them to vacate the flats, on sale of the flats being sanctioned by the Court The custodian shall permit the members of family of late Shri Harshad Mehta to occupy the flats during the time that the process of the sale of the flats goes on In case no such undertakings are filed by the adult members as directed above, within the aforesaid period, the custodian shall stand appointed as receiver of the flats which are described in Exh 8 and Exh 8-1 to Misc Petition No. 41 of 1999 CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES Appellants 9 Mr. Mahesh Jethmalani, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants in assailing the said judgment of the learned Special Court inter alia raised the following contentions: (i Some of the entities having their asset base much more than actual liability, the impugned judgments are unsustainable There was no occasion for the Custodian to club all the notified entities in one block so as to be termed as Harshad Mehta Group and/or to club their assets and liabilities jointly Although in relation to a body corporate incorporated and registered under the Indian Companies Act, the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil would be applicable, but the same cannot be applied in case of individuals ii) Having regard to the fact that only three entitles out of eight were involved in the offences, the liability of Harshad Mehta could not have been clubbed for the purpose of directing attachment and consequent sale of the properties which exclusively belong to them The liabilities of Harshad Mehta, who was a sui generis, could have been recovered from the properties held and possessed by him or from the companies floated by him but not from the individual entities; at least two of whom being medical practitioners have their income from other sources iv The books of accounts and other documents on the basis whereof the auditor's report had been made having not been allowed to be inspected by the Appellants herein on the plea that they had the knowledge thereabout, the same could not have been taken into consideration for the purpose of passing of the impugned order or otherwise v) The Appellants having preferred appeals against the income tax orders of assessment passed by the authority and the same having been set aside, no liability to pay income tax by the Appellants as of now being existing, the residential properties could not have been sold vi) Drawing our attention to a representative chart showing the discrepancies in the accounts of Mrs. Deepika A. Mehta as shown in (a) affidavit by the Custodian; (b) Books of Accounts maintained by the Appellants; and (c Auditor's Report, it was submitted that the Auditor's Report could not have been relied upon vii A copy of the Auditor's Report having only been supplied during pendency of these appeals, the learned Special Judge committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment relying on or on the basis thereof Respondents Mr. Ashok H. Desai, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Custodian, on the other hand, would, inter alia, submit i)In view of the decision of this Court in L.S. Synthetics Ltd. v. Fairgrowth Financial Services Ltd. and Another [(2004) 11 SCC 456] 2004 Indlaw SC 715 all properties belonging to the notified persons being subject to automatic attachment, could be applied for discharge of the joint liabilities of the Harshad Mehta Group in terms of S. 11 of the Act ii)The applications for de-notification filed by the Appellants herein having been withdrawn, the contention raised by the Appellants that they are not liable in terms of the provisions of the Act are not open to question, particularly, in view of the fact that no application for de-notification could be filed subsequently as they had become barred by limitation iii)The order of assessment under the Income Tax Act having become final and binding as on the date when the orders of assessment were passed and, thus, mere filing of appeals, were not sufficient for raising a contention that the taxes did not become due Reliance in this behalf has been placed on B.C. Dalal 2005 Indlaw SC 1826 v. Custodian Civil Appeal No. 2795 of 2004] and The Kedarnath Jute Mfg Co. Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Income Tax Central), Calcutta [(1972) 3 SCC 252] 1971 Indlaw SC 841 iv)The Appellants herein, apart from the corporate entity which is a front company of late Harshad Mehta, have received large loans, advances and credits from the Harshad Mehta Group and there had been intermingling of the assets to the tune of crores of rupees, they cannot escape their liabilities under the Act The affidavit filed by the Appellants herein before the Special Court clearly shows that the liabilities exceed the assets in all cases Even in the case of Dr. Pratima Mehta wherein some excesses has been shown, if the interest is calculated for the last over 13 years of the amount received, the liabilities would exceed the assets v) The assets and liabilities of each of the entities having been audited by the Chartered Accountants, it is evident from the reports that in all cases liabilities exceed the assets vi)The decretal amount against the Harshad Mehta Group also would exceed Rs 4339 crores and, thus, the assets held by the Appellants are wholly insufficient to meet the liabilities vii)Furthermore, the Appellants are also unable to maintain their residential properties as the Custodian had to pay a sum of Rs 1.06 crores towards the maintenance of the said residential properties The assets of the Harshad Mehta Group are valued at Rs 972 crores apart from the income tax dues whereas the aggregate amount of income tax dues exceed Rs 13,800 crores viii)Dr. Hitesh Mehta and Dr. Pratima Mehta who are medical practitioners by profession having affirmed affidavits admitting that the share broking and investment businesses which were part of family businesses were undertaken and conducted by late Harshad Mehta and they had no knowledge thereabout nor were they involved therewith they at this stage cannot be permitted to turn round and contend that they have nothing to do with the liabilities of Late Harshad Mehta ix)The sale of commercial property had never been seriously contested by the Appellants and in fact the contention of the Appellants herein before the Special Court was that if the commercial properties were sold, there would be no need to sell the residential properties Even before this Court, the sale of commercial properties had not been questioned A large number of commercial properties having already been sold and third party rights having been created, this Court should not interfere with the impugned judgment THE ACT The Statement of Objects and Reasons for enacting the Act reads as under: \"(1) In the course of the investigations by the Reserve Bank of India, large scale irregularities and malpractices were noticed in transactions in both the Government and other securities, indulged in by some brokers in collusion with the employees of various banks and financial institutions The said irregularities and malpractices led to the diversion of funds from banks and financial institutions to the individual accounts of certain brokers 2) To deal with the situation and in particular to ensure speedy recovery of the huge amount involved, to punish the guilty and restore confidence in and maintain the basic integrity and credibility of the banks and financial institutions the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Ordinance, 1992, was promulgated on the 6th June, 1992 The Ordinance provides for the establishment of a Special Court with a sitting Judge of a High Court for speedy trial of offences relating to transactions in securities and disposal of properties attached It also provides for appointment of one or more custodians for attaching the property of the offenders with a view to prevent diversion of such properties by the offenders S. 3 of the Act provides for appointment and functions of the Custodian Sub-s 2) of S. 3 postulates that the Custodian may, on being satisfied on information received that any person has been involved in any offence relating to transactions in securities after the 1st day of April, 1991 and on and before 6th June, 1992 (the Statutory Period), notify the name of such person in the Official Gazette 3) of S. 3 contains a non-obstante clause providing that on and from the date of notification under sub-section (2), any property, movable or immovable, or both, belonging to any person notified under that sub-section shall stand attached simultaneously with the issue of the notification and such attached properties may be dealt with by the Custodian in such manner as the Special Court may direct In the Ordinance which preceded the Act, there was no provision for giving post facto hearing to a notified person for cancellation of notification, but such a provision has been made in the Act, as would appear from S. 4(2) thereof 1) of S. 4 of the Act reads as under: \"Contracts entered into fraudulently may be cancelled.-- If the Custodian is satisfied, after such inquiry as he may think fit, that any contract or agreement entered into at any time after the 1st day of April, 1991 and on and before the 6th June, 1992 in relation to any property of the person notified under sub-s 2) of s. 3 has been entered into fraudulently or to defeat the provisions of this Act, he may cancel such contract or agreement and on such cancellation such property shall stand attached under this Act Provided that no contract or agreement shall be cancelled except after giving to the parties to the contract or agreement a reasonable opportunity of being heard 2) of Section 4, however, provides for a hearing as regard correctness or otherwise of the notification notifying a person in this behalf, in the event, an appropriate application therefor is filed within 30 days of the issuance of such notification S. 5 provides for establishment of the Special Court S. 7 confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Special Court Any prosecution in respect of any offence referred to in sub-s 2) of S. 3 pending in any Court is required to be transferred to the Special Court S. 9 provides for the procedure and powers of the Special Court Section 9-A, which was inserted by Act 24 of 1994 with effect from 25th January, 1994, confers all such jurisdiction, powers and authority as were exercisable, immediately before such commencement by any Civil Court in relation to the matter specified therein S. 11 of the Act reads as under: \"Discharge of liabilities Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code and any other law for the time being in force, the Special Court may make such order as it may deem fit directing the Custodian for the disposal of the property under attachment The following liabilities shall be paid or discharged in full, as far as may be, in the order as under: (a) all revenues, taxes, cesses and rates due from the persons notified by the Custodian under sub-s 2) of S. 3 to the Central Government or any State Government or any local authority; (b) all amounts due from the person so notified by the Custodian to any bank or financial institution or mutual fund; and (c) any other liability as may be specified by the Special Court from time to time ANALYSIS OF THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS The Act provides for stringent measures It was enacted for dealing with an extra-ordinary situation in the sense that any person who was involved in any offence relating to transaction of any security may be notified whereupon, all his properties stand attached The provision contained in the Act being stringent in nature, the purport and intent thereof must be ascertained having regard to the purpose and object it seeks to achieve The right of a person notified to file an application or to raise a defence that he is not liable in terms of the provisions of the Act or in any event, the properties attached should not be sold in discharge of the liabilities can be taken at the initial stage by filing an application in terms of Sub-s 2) of S. 4 of the Act But, at the stage when liabilities are required to be discharged, the notified person may inter alia raise a contention inter alia for the purpose of establishing that the properties held and possessed by them are sufficient to meet their liabilities In terms of the provisions of the Act, the Special Court had been conferred a very wide power RECEDENTS AS REGARD SCOPE OF THE ACT Constitutionality and / or interpretation of the Act came up for consideration before this Court in Harshad Shantilal Mehta 1998 Indlaw SC 732 v. Custodian and Others [(1998) 5 SCC 1] wherein the following questions were framed: \"What is meant by revenues, taxes, cesses and rates due Does the word \"due\" refer merely to the liability to pay such taxes etc., or does it refer to a liability which has crystallised into a legally ascertained sum immediately payable Do the taxes [in cl a) of S. 11(2)] refer only to taxes relating to a specific period or to all taxes due from the notified person At what point of time should the taxes have become due Does the Special Court have any discretion relating to the extent of payments to be made under S. 11(2)(a) from out of the attached funds/property Whether taxes include penalty or interest Whether the Special Court has the power to absolve a notified person from payment of penalty or interest for a period subsequent to the date of his notification u/s In the alternative, is a notified person liable to payment of penalty or interest arising from his inability to pay taxes after his notification As regard, Question No. 1, it was held: \"In the present case, the words \"taxes due\" occur in a section dealing with distribution of property At this stage the taxes \"due\" have to be actually paid out Therefore, the phrase \"taxes due\" cannot refer merely to a liability created by the charging section to pay the tax under the relevant law It must refer to an ascertained liability for payment of taxes quantified in accordance with law In other words, taxes as assessed which are presently payable by the notified person are taxes which have to be taken into account under S. 11(2)(a) while distributing the property of the notified person Taxes which are not legally assessed or assessments which have not become final and binding on the assessee, are not covered under S. 11(2)(a) because unless it is an ascertained and quantified liability, disbursement cannot be made In the context of S. 11(2), therefore, \"the taxes due\" refer to \"taxes as finally assessed In regard to Question No. 2, it was opined: \"Every kind of tax liability of the notified person for any other period is not covered by S. 11(2)(a), although the liability may continue to be the liability of the notified person Such tax liability may be discharged either under the directions of the Special Court under S. 11(2)(c), or the taxing authority may recover the same from any subsequently acquired property of a notified person (vide Tejkumar Balakrishna Ruia v. A.K. Menon 1996 Indlaw SC 2403) or in any other manner from the notified person in accordance with law The priority, however, which is given under S. 11(2)(a) to such tax liability only covers such liability for the period 1-4-1991 to 6-6-1992 In respect of the Question No. 3, it was opined that the date of distribution arrives when the Special Court completes the examination of claims under Section 9-A and if on that date, any tax liability for the statutory period is legally assessed, and the assessment is final and binding on a notified person, that liability would be considered for payment u/s 11(1)(a subject to what follows So far as Question No. 4 is concerned, this Court despite upholding the contention of the Custodian that no question of any reopening of tax assessments before the Special Court would arise and the liability of the notified person to pay the tax will have to be determined under the machinery provided by the relevant tax law, observed: \"But the Special Court can decide how much of that liability will be discharged out of the funds in the hands of the Custodian This is because the tax liability of a notified person having priority under S. 11(2)(a) is only tax liability pertaining to the \"statutory period Secondly payment in full may or may not be made by the Special Court depending upon various circumstances The Special Court can, for this purpose, examine whether there is any fraud, collusion or miscarriage of justice in assessment proceedings The assessee who is before the Special Court, is a person liable to be charged with an offence relating to transactions in securities He may not, in these circumstances, explain transactions before the Income Tax authorities, in case his position is prejudicially affected in defending criminal charges Then, on account of his property being attached, he may not be in a position to deposit the tax assessed or file appeals or further proceedings under the relevant tax law which he could have otherwise done Where the assessment is based on proper material and pertains to the \"statutory period\", the Special Court may not reduce the tax claimed and pay it out in full But if the assessment is a \"best judgment\" assessment, the Special Court may examine whether, for example, the income which is so assessed to tax bears comparison to the amounts attached by the Custodian, or whether the taxes so assessed are grossly disproportionate to the properties of the assessee in the hands of the Custodian, applying the Wednesbury Principle of Proportionality The Special Court may in these cases, scale down the tax liability to be paid out of the funds in the hands of the Custodian In regard to Question No. 5, this Court agreed with the finding of the Special Court that neither penalty nor interest can be considered as tax under S. 11(2)(a) of the Act So far Question No. 6 is concerned, it was held that the remedy of a notified person who is assessed to penalty or interest, after the notified period, would be entitled to move the appropriate authority under the taxing statute stating: \"If it is open to him under the relevant taxing statute to contend that he was unable to pay his taxes on account of the attachment of all his properties under the Special Court Act, and that there is a valid reason why penalty or interest should not be imposed upon him after the date of notification, the authorities concerned under the taxing statute can take notice of these circumstances in accordance with law for the purpose of deciding whether penalty or interest can be imposed on the notified person The Special Court is required to consider this question only from the point of view of distributing any part of the surplus assets in the hands of the Custodian after the discharge of liabilities u/ss 11(2)(a) and 11(2)(b The Special Court has full discretion under S. 11(2)(c) to decide whether such claim for penalty or interest should be paid out of any surplus funds in the hands of the Custodian We must, however, notice that reliance was sought to be placed on the said judgment wherein reference was made to a Bombay High Court judgment in Hitesh Shantilal Mehta v. Union of India 1992) 3 Bom CR 716] 1992 Indlaw MUM 6066 wherein it was held: \"If the person ... approaches the Special Court and makes out, for example, a case that the property which is attached has no nexus of any sort with the illegal dealings in securities belonging to banks and financial institutions during the relevant period and/or that there are no claims or liabilities which have to be satisfied by attachment and sale of such property, in our view, the Special Court would have the power to direct the Custodian to release such property from attachment But, the said observation was held to be not laying down a law by a 3-Judge Bench of this Court in L.S. Synthetics Ltd. v. Fairgrowth Financial Services Ltd. and Another [(2004) 11 SCC 456] 2004 Indlaw SC 715 holding: \"(i A notified party has the requisite locus to bring the fact to the notice of the Special Court that certain sum is owing and due to him from a third party whereupon a proceeding can be initiated for recovery thereof by the Custodian and consequent application thereof in discharge of the liability of the notified person ii) Sub-s 3) of S. 3 should be literally construed and so construed, all properties belonging to the notified person shall be subject to attachment which may, consequently, be applied for discharge of his liabilities in terms of S. 11 of the said Act The provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 have no application in relation to the proceedings under the said Act The ratio of the said decision as regard applicability of the Limitation Act was further considered by a Division bench of this Court in Fairgrowth Investments Ltd v. Custodian [(2004) 11 SCC 472] 2004 Indlaw SC 868 wherein it was held that S. 5 of the Limitation Act will have no application in relation to an application falling under Sub-s 2) of S. 4 of the Act stating: \"It is enough for the purpose of this appeal to hold that S. 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 does not apply to proceedings under S. 4(2) of the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities) Act, 1992 Since the appellant's petition of objection had been filed much beyond the period prescribed under that section, the Special Court was right in rejecting the petition in limine The appeal is accordingly dismissed but without any order as to costs The Appellants herein are notified persons in terms of the provisions of the Act Therefore, all the properties belonging to them stand attached Such attachment being automatic, no finding was required to be arrived at that the same had been acquired either during the notified period or the Appellants were involved in offences in transactions in securities In Tejkumar Balakrishna Ruia v. A.K. Menon and Another [(1997) 9 SCC 123] 1996 Indlaw SC 2403, this Court held: \"In our view, the terms of sub-s 3) of S. 3 are clear By reason thereof, the property that belongs to a notified person stands attached simultaneously with the issue of the notification that makes him a notified party The words \"on and from the date of notification\" indicate the point of time at which the attachment takes effect; this is reiterated by the words \"shall stand attached simultaneously with the issue of the notification This also indicates that no separate notification or order in regard to the attachment is necessary Neither the words \"on and from the date of notification\" nor the word 'property' lead to the conclusion that what is attached is not only that property which the notified person owned or was possessed of on the date of the notification but also all such property as he might acquire at any time thereafter The intention to attach property which did not belong to the notified person on the date of the notification but which he might acquire later would, had it been there, have been clearly expressed and sub-s 3) would have stated that such property would stand attached the moment it was acquired by the notified person The Act would also have made provision for a subsistence allowance or the like for the notified person It seems to us that to give to S. 3(3) the wide meaning that has been ascribed to it in the judgment and order under appeal would render it perilously close to being held unconstitutional, for it would deprive the notified person, so long as he remained a notified person, from earning a livelihood Even to say that such interpretation would reduce a notified person to beggary would not be accurate  because the alms that he received, being his property, would stand attached The apprehension expressed by the Special Court does not appear to be well founded: if what a notified person obtains by way of purported income or gift or inheritance is really his own money, such money would, upon establishment of the fact, stand attached automatically under the provisions of S. 3(3 In any event, it is for Parliament to enact a law that meets all contingencies The courts must interpret the law as it reads While a purposive interpretation is permissible where two interpretations are possible, the purposive interpretation must be such as preserves the constitutionality of the provision It has further been held that the property, be shares, dividends and bonus and rights shares, would also be attached property ISSUES i)Whether the Appellants being not involved in offences in transactions in securities could have been proceeded against in terms of the provisions of the Act ii)Whether individual liabilities of the Appellants ought to have been separately considered by the Special Court as not a part of Harshad Mehta Group iii)Whether the tax liabilities could not have been held to be due as the order of assessments did not become final and binding iv)Whether the commercial properties could have been sold in auction v)Whether the residential properties should have been released from attachment Before adverting to the questions raised herein, we may notice that both the parties have raised several contentions before us which have not precisely been raised before the learned Special Judge Several subsequent events have also been brought to our notice The parties have also filed several charts before us showing individual assets and liabilities It has, as noticed hereinbefore, further been contended that various best judgment assessment passed by the Assessing Authority against some of the Appellants have been set aside in appeal and the matters are pending reassessment before the Assessing Authority The Appellants' case is that the individual and corporate Appellants other than Harshad Mehta, Ashwin Mehta and Sudhir Mehta filed applications, within the prescribed period, before the Special Court praying for their de-notifications However, by an order dated 14.July.2000, the said applications were permitted to be withdrawn with a permission to re-file the same It is not in dispute that the said applications are pending for consideration before the Special Court They have not been heard What would be the effect of the jurisdictional question as regard maintainability of the said application, being barred by limitation, would indisputably fall for consideration before the Special Court We, therefore, as at present advised, refrain ourselves from adverting to the said question The question, however, before us is as to whether any contention which may not have a direct bearing with the question as to whether the Special Court could entertain their applications for de-notifications could be raised by way of defence It is no doubt true that the law of limitation bars a remedy but not a right See Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The State of Bombay and others, AIR 1958 SC 338, Savitra Khandu Beradi v. Nagar Agricultural Sale and Purchase Co-operative Society Ltd. Ahmednagar and others AIR 1957 Bom 178] 1957 Indlaw MUM 110 and Hari Raj Singh v. Sanchalak Panchayat Raj U.P. Govt Lucknow and others AIR 1968 All 246], 1967 Indlaw ALL 16 but as observed hereinbefore it would not be proper for us to consider as to whether such a remedy being not available, in terms of S. 4(2) of the Act can still be determined if raised by way of defence In L.S. Synthetics Ltd 2004 Indlaw SC 715 (supra), this Court observed: \"A statute of limitation bars a remedy and not a right Although a remedy is barred, a defence can be raised In construing a special statute providing for limitation, consideration of plea of hardship is irrelevant A special statute providing for special or no period of limitation must receive a liberal and broader construction and not a rigid or a narrow one The intent and purport of Parliament enacting the said Act furthermore must be given its full effect We are, therefore, of the opinion that the provisions of the Limitation Act have no application, so far as directions required to be issued by the Special Court relating to the disposal of attached property, are concerned Although, we do not intend to enter into the correctness or otherwise of the said contention of the Appellants at this stage, however, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that they being notified persons, all their properties would be deemed to be automatically attached as a consequent thereto For the said purpose, it is not necessary that they should be accused of commission of an offence as such The contention of the Appellants to the effect that their properties should have been attached only towards the liabilities incurred by the parties in respect of the transactions made during the Statutory Period, cannot be accepted as all the Appellants being notified, the attachment of the assets would be automatic L.S. Synthetics Ltd. 2004 Indlaw SC 715 (supra However, the contention of the Appellants that the properties held by them otherwise are sufficient to meet their liabilities was required to be gone into, as, in our considered opinion, there cannot be a any dispute that the Appellants have such a right A corporate veil indisputably can be lifted on several grounds LIFTING THE CORPORATE VEIL The principle of lifting the corporate veil, however, ipso facto would not apply to the individuals The Custodian in a case of this nature may, however, show that the transactions entered into apparently by Harshad Mehta were intimately connected with acquisition of properties in the name of others A transaction of Benami indisputably can be a subject matter of a lies in terms of S. 4(1) of the Act as and when such a question is raised, the same may have to be dealt with by the Special Court appropriately However, nexus between several persons in dealing with the matter may be established by the Custodian The fact, however, remains that the copies of the documents, books of accounts and other records on the basis whereof the Auditors appointed by the Court filed their reports had not been shown to the Appellants herein, on the premise that they were in know of the things As the said question has not been gone into by the learned Judge, Special Court, it is necessary that the same be considered and appropriately dealt with The Appellants, however, raised the following contentions: (i) That the statement prepared by the Custodian and Exhibited as 'C' to his affidavit in rejoinder dated 1.October.2003 was based on material, at least, all of which were not connected to the Appellants as were pointed out before the Court The learned Special Judge has accepted the figures stated by the Custodian at face value without probing the basis on which the statement was prepared, even though the Appellants in their sur-rejoinder asserted that the figures in the statement were contrary to both the books of accounts drawn by them as also the Auditor's report In Para 14 of the sur-rejoinder, the Appellants denied the asset and liability position as arrived at by the Custodian According to the Appellants, the Custodian has under-estimated the assets and exaggerated and overstated their liabilities A triable issue had been raised and the Custodian's petition should have been converted into a suit This was not done In fact, according to the Appellants, there are gross errors in the material relied upon by the Custodian The said contention must be properly adjudged Several charts have been filed before us by the Appellants to show: (i) liabilities have been exaggerated by the Custodian No credit for Rs 1227 crores released to revenue on interest are given by the Custodian ii) liabilities have been shown in relation to unperformed contracts Credits not given for relief obtained from Income Tax Subsequent to the filing of the present appeal in a large number of cases the revenue demands have been set aside It is open to the Appellants, herein to show that even if they continued to be notified, the Custodian was not right in clubbing all the individual members of the family as a single entity styled as Harshad Mehta Group It is interesting to note that the properties belonging to the mother of Harshad Mehta has since been released from attachment The learned Special Court, despite, such a contention having been raised by the Appellants in their affidavit in reply did not advert thereto It is furthermore not in dispute that pursuant to or in furtherance of the directions issued by the learned Special Court, the accounts of all entities, be it corporate or individual, were drawn up separately which approach had not been dis-approved by the Auditor appointed by the Special Court Even in the rejoinder filed by the Custodian, e.g., paragraphs 14, 20, 21 and 22, before the Special Court, such contentions have been raised A sur-rejoinder thereto was filed on 15.October.2003 and in paragraphs 1 to 6 thereof, the said statements were denied and disputed Our attention has also been drawn to a letter dated 7.October.2003 addressed by all the Appellants to the Office of the Custodian wherein the attention of the Custodian was drawn to the fact that all the documents relied upon by him had not been permitted to be inspected and he was requested to forward a report prepared by the Chartered Accountants in respect of the individual addressors of the letters The said letter was replied by the Custodian by his letter dated 10.October.2003 wherein none of the queries contained in paragraphs 3 to 8 of the said letter was even attempted to be answered The Appellants, herein contended that the Custodian did not furnish the requisite particulars thereof and inspection was refused on the grounds stated therein The learned Special Court, in the impugned order, stated: (i the grand total of the admitted liability, thus, comes to Rs 7,279,127,317.15 the amount of priority demand of Income Tax liabilities comes to Rs. 18,297,576,248 the estimated value of the immovable properties of this group is Rs 184,030,038 Thus, the total value of the assets as per the affidavit filed on behalf of the Custodian of Harshad Mehta Group is Rs 9,727,332,166.94 v Thus, taking into consideration the total of the decretal amount and the income-tax liability, it is clear that the total assets of Harshad Mehta group would be far below the liabilities In arriving at the said finding, no contention of the parties raised in their respective affidavits had been adverted to nor any material filed before it was analysed In our opinion, the learned Judge, Special Court should have analysed the respective contentions of the parties in greater details and in particular in regard to assets and liabilities of the separate entities and having regard to the contentions raised by them that they are not part of the Harshad Mehta Group and their individual liabilities can be met from the assets held and possessed by them separately The statement annexed to the affidavit of the Custodian showed individual break-up and in that view of the matter the net asset picture of each individual of the Appellants herein on individual basis and the effect thereof, in our opinion, should have received serious consideration at the hands of the learned Special Court The Custodian in terms of the directions issued by the learned Special Court had affirmed an affidavit putting on record the assets and liabilities of each of the members of the so-called Harshad Mehta Group on an individual basis Allegedly, therein it was shown that the individuals had received large loans, advances, credits from the Harshad Mehta Group and there had been intermingling of the assets to the tune of crores of rupees Before us, Mr. Desai had filed a chart for showing the same The said chart, however, shows that at least Mrs. Deepika Mehta held assets more than her liabilities Mr. Desai contended that if interest is calculated, liabilities would be more than assets But, the said chart has been drawn up on the basis of the audited accounts, the correctness whereof is itself in dispute Before us a chart has been produced by the Appellants herein as regards Mrs. Deepika Mehta to show her liabilities payable as on 8th June, 1992 which are as under: \"Chart showing comparison of payables as on 8th June, 1992 We, therefore, have not been given a clear picture as to the correctness or otherwise of the affidavit filed by the Custodian vis-a-vis the Books of Accounts which have been maintained by the Appellants themselves as well as the Auditor's Report The learned Judge merely accepted the figures mentioned in the affidavit of the Custodian and relied thereupon in the judgment without discussing the contentions and arguments raised on behalf of the Appellants, herein We, therefore, are of the opinion, in the interest of justice, that it is necessary to give another opportunity of hearing to the Appellants It is true that horrendous figures as regard the liabilities of Harshad Mehta have been projected before us but the same had been shown to be of the entire Group If the liabilities of the individual entities are not treated as that of the group, for one reason or the other, indisputably, liability of those who have nothing to do with the dealings of Harshad Mehta either in their individual capacities or as Directors of some company or otherwise must be dealt with separately The contention raised on behalf of the Appellants is that the Harshad Mehta should be considered to be sui generis and the Custodian may realize his dues from his personal assets as also of those with which he was concerned together with the assets of his front companies but such liability should not be fastened upon others who had nothing to do therewith As regards liabilities of Harshad Mehta, the Appellants contended that since his expiry in the year 2001 his legal interests are not being defended both in the court as well as before the revenue, as a result, liabilities have been foisted upon him a large part which is on account of interest and penalties His death has also forced upon him bankruptcy On the other hand, the contention of the Custodian is that the Appellants had not only taken huge loans or advances from Harshad Mehta in one capacity or the other but also even transactions and shares were made by Harshad Mehta on their behalf Further contention of the Custodian is that even Dr. Hitesh Mehta and Dr. Pratima Mehta have admitted that they had no knowledge about the transactions This may be so, but then the effect of the rival contentions was required to be gone into by the learned Special Court A finding of fact arrived at upon discussing and analyzing the respective contentions could have gone a long way in assisting this Court in arriving at a correct conclusion The learned Judge proceeded on the basis that the assets and liabilities, joint and collective, of all those who are related with Harshad Mehta as also the corporate entities in which he was a Director or had some other interest must be considered as a group Even in this behalf, it was necessary for the Special Judge to assign sufficient and cogent reasons A question may further arise as to whether the learned Judge was correct in considering the individual liabilities of the notified parties as the liabilities of the group If those individuals, who had no connection with Harshad Mehta could not have been proceeded against for meeting the liabilities of Harshad Mehta jointly or severally, a clear finding was required to be arrived at Only because there had been large intermingling and flow of funds from Harshad Mehta and inter se within the group, the same by itself may not justify the conclusion that all of their assets were required to be sold irrespective of their individual involvement It was, thus, necessary for the learned Special Court to arrive at a firm conclusion as regard the involvement of the individuals with Harshad Mehta, if any, and the extent of his liability as such Furthermore, the question as regard liability of the parties should have been determined at the stage of Section 9-A of the Act The Appellants have contended that the Custodian had taken contradictory or inconsistent stand inasmuch as the liabilities of all the entities were treated to be joint liabilities of Harshad Mehta group He furthermore wanted to treat the liabilities of the notified entities also as their separate liabilities He has proceeded on the basis that even if the assets and liabilities of all individuals is taken on an individual basis, the liabilities would exceed assets in the case of each individual and corporate entity It had, however, never been the case of the Custodian that the examination of claims of all the notified parties is complete It does not appear that claims inter se between the entities within the so-called group had ever been taken into consideration The Custodian does not appear to have preferred claims before the Special Court on behalf of the largest lender on the so-called group against those he had to recover loans Such claims may also be preferred The Act confers wide power upon the Custodian and the learned Special Court and in that view of the matter, having regard to the principles of natural justice, the judgment and order of the learned Judge, Special Court should have furthermore been supported by sufficient and cogent reasons TAX LIABILITY It is not in dispute that the tax liabilities of the Appellants individually were assessed on the basis of Best Judgment assessment It is, furthermore not in dispute that in a large number of cases the appellate authorities have set aside Best Judgment assessments The contention of the Appellant to the effect that the income tax dues should have been considered at the point of time when they become recoverable cannot be accepted having regard to the 3-Judge Bench decision of this Court in B.C. Dalal 2005 Indlaw SC 1826 (supra) wherein this Court categorically held that in absence of any order of stay granted by the higher court, the liabilities would remain We may further notice that the learned Special Court relied upon a decision in Custodian v. Union of India and Ors Misc Petition No. 64 of 1998, disposed of on 17th August, 2000] wherein allegedly a dichotomy between sale and distribution was sought to be resolved in terms of the decision of this Court in Harshad Shantilal Mehta Indlaw SC 732 (supra), the appeal where against being Civil Appeal No. 5812 of 2000 was dismissed by this Court by an order dated 4.December.2000 stating that it was in agreement with the decision of the Special Court which called for no interference This Court, therefore, has laid down a law that mere filing of an appeal is not sufficient, particularly, when there is no order of stay on recovery has been granted and the demand is outstanding In Kedarnath Jute Mfg. Co. Ltd. 1971 Indlaw SC 841 (supra) this Court has held: \"Although that liability cannot be enforced till the quantification is effected by assessment proceedings, the liability for payment of tax is independent of the assessment It is significant that in the present case, the liability had even been quantified and a demand had been created in the sum of Rs 1,49,776 by means of the notice, dated November 21, 1957, during the pendency of the assessment proceedings before the Income Tax Officer and before the finalisation of the assessment It is not possible to comprehend how the liability would cease to be one because the assessee had taken proceedings before higher authorities for getting it reduced or wiped out so long as the contention of the assessee did not prevail with regard to the quantum of liability etc But, in this case, the orders of assessment have been set aside If the orders of assessment have been set aside the liabilities of the Appellants have to be worked out on the basis of the new orders of assessment So long, such orders of assessment are not passed by the competent assessing authorities, it cannot be said that the Appellants are liable to pay a huge amount by way of income tax dues on the basis of such orders of assessment which have since been set aside A chart has been annexed to the additional written submissions filed by Mr. Desai, which originated from a letter dated 9th December, 2005 issued by the Office of the Commissioner of Income Tax showing the current status of the liabilities of the individual members of the Harshad Mehta group in the following terms: \"(I Ashwin Mehta Rs 1396 crores, (II Deepika Mehta Rs 120 crores (even after deducting the amount set aside by ITAT it exceeds Rs. 63 crores III Late Harshad Mehta Rs 11829 crores IV) Jyoti Mehta Rs 1457 crores V) Hitesh Mehta Rs 73 crores (VI Pratima Mehta Rs 115 crores (even after deducting the amount set aside by ITAT it exceeds Rs 35 crores) (VII Sudhir Mehta Rs 339 crores (VIII Aatur Holdings Rs 15.95 crores (even after deducting the amount set aside by ITAT 2.7 crores The Custodian has further brought on records that if the transactions by or on behalf of corporate entity, viz., Aatur Holdings Pvt. Ltd. and Dr. Pratima Mehta by way of illustration are taken into consideration, the same would reveal their modus operandi to the effect that the moneys were diverted from banks and financial institutions by late Harshad Mehta which were in turn diverted to his family concerns and family members These moneys were used for speculative transactions and securities and the profits generated was used for acquiring assets The learned Special Court, having not arrived at such a finding, this Court is not in a position to go into the correctness or otherwise thereabout In any view of the matter, the learned Judge, Special Court having not dealt with the question as regard the mode and manner of disbursements of the amount so far as the tax liabilities of the Appellants are concerned elaborately, the same requires fresh determination in the light of the decision of this Court in Harshad Shantilal Mehta 1998 Indlaw SC 732 (supra In fact, the Appellants have brought on records various orders passed by Income Tax Appellate Authorities to show that the demands of the revenue have been set aside Furthermore, the orders of the appellate authority have been passed during pendency of this appeal This Court, it is trite, can take into consideration the subsequent events Such subsequent events could also be taken into consideration for the purpose of review In Board of Control for Cricket in India and Another v. Netaji Cricket Club and Others [(2005) 4 SCC 741] 2005 Indlaw SC 1243 this Court held: \"It is also not correct to contend that the Court while exercising its review jurisdiction in any situation whatsoever cannot take into consideration a subsequent event In a case of this nature when the Court accepts its own mistake in understanding the nature and purport of the undertaking given by the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Board and its correlation with as to what transpired in the AGM of the Board held on 29-9-2004, the subsequent event may be taken into consideration by the Court for the purpose of rectifying its own mistake In view of the aforementioned pronouncement of law, we are of the opinion that it is absolutely necessary to request the learned Special Court to consider the matter afresh Sale of commercial properties has never been seriously contested by the Appellants In fact one of the contentions raised on behalf of the Appellants had been that if commercial properties are sold, there would be no need to sale the residential properties This Court also in its order dated 5th May, 2004 clarified that the interim order dated 30th January, 2004 shall not be applicable as regard sale of commercial properties as even before this Court the same had not been questioned It is, furthermore, not in dispute that third party rights have since been created by reason of sale of a large number of commercial properties By an order dated 30th January, 2004, while admitting the appeals, this Court directed: \"The learned counsel for the Custodian brings on record the result of the bids and the order of the Special Court dated 17.December.2003 and 20.January.2004 The learned counsel for the Appellants proposes to offer his comments on the bids and the two orders of the Special Court Let it be done within two weeks The process of finalizing the bids according to law may be proceeded ahead by the Special Court However, the finalization shall be subject to the result of these appeals The said order, however, was modified and clarified by an order dated 5th May, 2004 that the same shall not apply to the sale of commercial properties in view of the order of the learned Judge, Special Court dated 17th October, 2003 wherein it was pointed out that the notified parties did not dispute the commercial properties being put to sale by the Custodian In that view of the matter, evidently, creation of any third party interest is no longer in dispute nor the same is subject to any order of this Court In any event, ordinarily, a bona fide purchaser for value in an action sale is treated differently than a decree holder purchasing such properties In the former event, even if such a decree is set aside, the interest of the bona fide purchaser in an auction sale is saved See Zain-ul-Abdin Khan v. Muhammad Asghar Ali Khan - 15 IA 12 1887 Indlaw PC 13 The said decision has been affirmed by this Court in Gurjoginder Singh v. Jaswant Kaur Smt.) and Another [(1994) 2 SCC 368] 1994 Indlaw SC 1613 In Janak Raj v. Gurdial Singh and Anr 1967 (2) SCR 77], 1966 Indlaw SC 120 this Court confirmed a sale in favour of the Appellant therein who was a stranger to the suit being the auction purchaser of the judgment-debtor's immovable property in execution of an ex parte money decree in terms of Order XXXI Rule 92, Civil Procedure Code Despite the fact that ordinarily a sale can be set aside only under Rules 89, 90 and 91 of Order XXXI, it was opined that the court is bound to confirm the sale and direct the grant of a certificate vesting the title in the purchaser as from the date of sale when no application in term of Rule 92 was made or when such application was made and disallowed and in support thereof Zain-ul-Abdin Khan 1887 Indlaw PC 13 (supra) and various other decisions were referred to In Padanathil Ruqmini Amma v. P.K. Abdulla [(1996) 7 SCC 668] 1996 Indlaw SC 3096, this Court making a distinction between decree-holder auction purchaser himself and a third party bona fide purchaser in an auction sale, observed : \"The ratio behind this distinction between a sale to a decree-holder and a sale to a stranger is that the court, as a matter of policy, will protect honest outsider purchasers at sales held in the execution of its decrees, although the sales may be subsequently set aside, when such purchasers are not parties to the suit But for such protection, the properties which are sold in court auctions would not fetch a proper price and the decree-holder himself would suffer The same consideration does not apply when the decree-holder is himself the purchaser and the decree in his favour is set aside He is a party to the litigation and is very much aware of the vicissitudes of litigation and needs no protection We, therefore, do not interfere with that part of the order whereby and wherewith the auction sale, as regard commercial properties, had been directed by the learned Judge, Special Court The learned Judge, Special Court, may, therefore, proceed to pass an appropriate order as regard confirmation of the sale of such properties RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY In these appeals, we are concerned with sale of eight residential flats in a building known as Madhuli The flat belonging to the mother of Late Harshad Mehta has been released The flats, however, during pendency of these appeals have been sold in auction One of the flats being flat No. 202 Arunachal Bhawan, Barakhamba Road, is subject matter of a separate proceeding pending before this Court, viz., Civil Appeal No. 681 of 2004 In these appeals, we are not concerned with the said flat Admittedly, the flats have been sold subject to the result of these appeals The flats have been sold on the basis of the joint liabilities of the Appellants together with Harshad Mehta and other companies as a group The liabilities of the Appellants, in view of our findings aforementioned, are required to be considered afresh by the learned Judge, Special Court The purchasers have also filed applications for their impleadment in these appeals We, however, have not heard the purchasers as the question as to whether the auction sale of the said flats will be confirmed or not will depend upon the ultimate finding of the learned Judge, Special Court upon consideration of the matter afresh in the light of the observations made hereinbefore We, therefore, would direct that the confirmation of sale of those flats be considered and appropriate order thereupon may be passed by the learned Special Court while considering the matter afresh In the light of the directions issued herein, it would be for the purchasers of the said flats to wait till a final decision is made or take back the amount deposited by them, subject to any other or further order (s) that may be passed by the learned Special Judge CONCLUSION In view of our foregoing discussions, we are of the opinion that: (i The contention of the Appellants that they being not involved in offences in transactions in securities could not have been proceeded in terms of the provisions of the Act cannot be accepted in view of the fact that they have been notified in terms thereof The Appellants being notified persons all their personal properties stood automatically attached and any other income from such attached properties would also stand attached The question as to whether the Appellants could have been considered to be part of Harshad Mehta Group by the learned Special Court need not be determined by us as, at present advised, in view of the fact that appropriate applications in this behalf are pending consideration before the learned Special Court The question as regard intermingling of accounts by the Appellants, herein with that of the Harshad Mehta Group and/ or any other or further contentions raised by the parties hereto before us shall receive due consideration of the learned Judge, Special Court afresh in the light of the observations made hereinbefore As regard the tax liabilities of the Appellants, herein, we would request the learned Judge, Special Court to consider the matter afresh in the light of the observations made hereinbefore The learned Judge, Special Court, in this behalf, having regard to the fact that several orders of Best Judgment Assessment have been passed by the Assessing Authority, may take into consideration the ratio laid down in the decision of this Court in Harshad Shantilal Mehta The learned Special Court shall proceed to pass appropriate orders as regard confirmation of the auction sales in respect of commercial properties v) As regard, sale of residential properties, an appropriate order may be passed by the learned Judge, Special Court in the light of the observations made hereinbefore vi We direct the Custodian to permit the Appellants to have inspection of all the documents in his power or possession in the premises of the Special Court in the presence of an officer of the court Such documents must be placed for inspection for one week continuously upon giving due notice therefor to the Appellants jointly As the Appellants have been represented in all the proceedings jointly, only one of them would be nominated by them to have the inspection thereof The Appellants shall be entitled to take the help of a Chartered or Cost Accountant and may make notes therefrom for their use in the pending proceeding The Appellants shall file their objections to the said report, if any, within ten days thereafter The Custodian may also take assistance and/ or further assistance from a Chartered Accountant of his choice A reply and/ or rejoinder thereto shall be filed within one week from the date of the receipt of the copy of the objection The parties shall file their respective documents within one week thereafter Such documents should be supported by affidavits Both the parties shall be entitled to inspect such documents and filed their responses thereto within one week thereafter The parties shall file the written submissions filed before this Court together with all charts before the learned Special Judge, Special Court within eight weeks from date viii The learned Judge, Special Court shall allow the parties to make brief oral submissions with pointed reference to their written submissions Such hearing in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case should continue from day to day ix The learned Judge, Special Court while hearing the matter in terms of this order shall also consider as to whether the auction sale should be confirmed or not It will also be open to the learned Judge, Special Court to pass an interim order or orders, as it may think fit and proper, in the event any occasion arises therefor x) We would, however, request the learned Special Judge, Special Court to complete the hearings of the matter, keeping in view of the fact that auction sale in respect of the residential premises is being consideration, as expeditiously as possible and not later than twelve weeks from the date of the receipt of the copy of this order Save and except for sufficient or cogent reasons, the learned Judge shall not grant any adjournment to either of the parties xi The learned Judge, Special Court shall take up the matter relating to confirmation of the auction sale in respect of the commercial properties immediately and pass an appropriate order thereupon within four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order If in the meanwhile orders of assessment are passed by the Income Tax Authorities, the Custodian shall be at liberty to bring the same to the notice of the learned Special Court which shall also be taken into consideration by the learned Judge, Special Court With the aforementioned observations and directions, these appeals are allowed The impugned judgments are set aside and the matter is remitted to the learned Judge, Special Court for consideration of the matter afresh However, the parties shall bear their own costs Appeals allowed",

    "data": "This appeal by special leave which is directed against the judgment and order dated April 24,1974 of the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras reversing the judgment and order dated April 19,1971 of the Single Judge of that Court passed in writ petition No.3822 of 1969 presented u/art.226 of the Constitution raises a complex but an interesting question relating to the construction of the phrases \"maternity benefit........for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately following that day\" occurring in s.5(1) of the Maternity Benefits Act,1961 Act LIII of 1961) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') which in view of s.2(1) of the Act is the law applicable even to women workers employed in plantations It appears that in October,1967,Subbammal,respondent No.2 herein,who is a woman worker employed in Mount Stuart Estate (hereinafter referred to as 'the establishment'),which is carrying on plantation industry,was allowed leave of absence by the establishment on the basis of a notice given by her of her expected delivery which actually took place on December 16,1967.After her delivery,the respondent was paid by her employers on account of maternity benefit an amount equivalent to what she would have earned on the basis of her average daily wage in 72 working days falling within twelve week's of the maternity period While calculating the aforesaid amount of maternity benefit,the establishment admittedly excluded twelve Sundays being wageless holidays,which fell during the period of the respondent's actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and the six weeks immediately following that day Dissatisfied with this computation,the respondent made a representation to her employers claiming maternity benefit for the entire period of twelve weeks under the Act.i.e.for 84 days on the plea that a week consisted of seven days As her demand did not evoke a favourable response,the respondent applied to the Labour Court,Coimbatore,under section 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act for redress of her grievance The claim preferred by the respondent was resisted by the appellant herein who contended that the respondent was admittedly working and was being paid only for six days in a week and that a pregnant woman worker is entitled to maternity benefit for 72 days which are the normal working days in twelve weeks and not for 84 days,as no wage is payable for the seventh day of the week i.e Sunday,which is a nonworking wageless holiday By its order dated February 26,1969,the Labour Court allowed the claim of the respondent Thereupon the establishment moved the High Court at Madras u art.226 of the Constitution challenging the,decision of the Labour Court contending that the claim made by the respondent was untenable as normally a worker works only for six days in a week and the maternity benefit had to be computed only for 72 days As against this,the respondent pleaded that the computation had to be made not with reference to the Actual number of working days but with reference to total number of days covered by twelve weeks i.e.84 days The Single Judge of the High Court to whom the case was assigned allowed the petition holding that twelve weeks for which maternity benefit is provided for in subs.(3) of s.5 of the Act must be taken to mean twelve weeks of work and the computation of the benefit had to be made with reference to the Actual days on which the woman would have worked but for her inability Aggrieved by this decision,the respondent filed an appeal u/cl.15 of the Letters Patent which,as already stated,was allowed by the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court observing that the maternity benefit which the respondent was entitled to receive was for the period of her absence before delivery including the day of delivery and also six weeks thereafter,each week consisting of seven days including Sundays Dissatisfied with this decision,the establishment has,already stated,come up in appeal to this Court by special leave We have heard Mr Pai,learned counsel for the appellant as also Mr Bhatt,who in view of the default in appearance of respondent No.2 and the importance of the point involved in the case was appointed as amicus cruaie We place on record our deep appreciation of the valuable assistance rendered to us by both of them Assailing the judgment and order under appeal,Mr Pai has urged that since legislative intent,as revealed from the scheme of s.5(1) of the Act is to compensate the woman worker who expects delivery for the loss that her forced absence from work on account of pregnancy and confinement may entail,the liability which has to be imposed on her employer cannot exceed the amount that she would have earned if she had not been compelled to avail of the maternity leave and since Sunday is a non-working wageless day,the employer cannot be made to pay for that day He has further urged that since u/s.5 (1) of the Act,the maternity benefit has to be computed with reference to the period of the workers' actual absence thereby meaning absence on days on which there was work excluding Sundays and the term 'week\" in the context of 'sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act is to be under stood as a week of work consisting of six days and in the instant case,respondent No.2 was working and earning wages for six days in a week,the seventh day being a wageless holiday,her claim cannot be sustained In support of his contention Mr Pai has referred us to the Full Bench decision of the Kerala High Court in Malayalam Plantations Ltd Cochin v Inspector of Plantation Mundakayam Ors.,(1975 Lab I.C.848=A.I.R.1975 Ker.86 1974 Indlaw KER 91,and to Convention No.103 concerning Maternity Protection Convention (Revised),1952 adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation Bhatt has,on the other hand,urged that the scheme of s.5 of the Act clearly indicates that a woman worker who expects delivery had to be paid maternity benefit for all the seven days of the week including Sundays falling within the ante-natal and post-natal periods specified in the s For a proper determination of the question involved in the appeal,it would,we think,be useful to refer to certain provisions of the Act which have a bearing on the subject matter of the controversy before US s.2(1) of the Act makes the Act applicable to every establishment being a factory,mine or plantation (including any such establishment belonging to Government and to every establishment wherein persons are employed for the exhibition of equastrain acrobatic and other performance Sub-s.(2) of s.2 of the Act specifically excludes the applicability of the provisions of the Act to any factory or other establishment to which the provisions of the Employees State Insurance Act,1948 apply for the time being.s.3(n) of the Act defines \"wages\" as under :- \"3(n).--Wages means all remuneration paid or payable in cash to a woman,if the terms of the contract of employment,express or implied,were fulfilled and includes- (1) such cash allowances (including dearness allowance and house rent allowance) as a woman is for the time being entitled to 2) incentive bonus; and (3) the money value of the concessional supply of food-grains and other articles,but does not include i) any bonus other than incentive bonus; (ii) over-time earnings and any deduction or payment on account of fines; (iii) any contribution paid or payable by the employer to any pension fund or provident fund or for the benefit of the woman under any law for the time being in force; and (iv) any gratuity payable on the termination of service The above definition,it would be noted,does not restrict the meaning of the term \"wages\" to contractual wages but gives the term a composite meaning covering all remunerations in the nature of cash allowances,incentive bonus and the money value of the concessional supply of foodgrains and other articles S.4 of the Act which prohibits the employment of,or work by,woman during certain period lays down :- \"4.Employment of,or work by,woman prohibited during certain period.- (1) No employer shall knowingly employ a woman in any establishment during the six weeks immediately following the day of her delivery or her mis-carriage No woman shall work in any establishment during the six weeks immediately following the day of her delivery or miscarriage 3) Without prejudice to the provisions of section 6,no pregnant woman shall,on a request being made by her in this behalf,be required by her employer to do during the period specified in sub-s.(4) any which is of an arduous nature or which involves long hours of standing,or which in any way is likely to interfere with her pregnancy or the normal development of the foetus,or is likely to cause her miscarriage or otherwise to adversely affect her health The period referred to in sub-s.(3) shall be- (a the period of one month immediately preceding the period of six weeks,before the date of her expected delivery; (b any period during the said period of six weeks for which the pregnant woman does not avail of leave of absence under section 6 S.5 of the Act which confers right to payment of maternity benefit on a woman worker provisions 5.Right to payment of maternity benefit.-(1)Subject to the provisions of this Act,every woman shall be entitled to,and her employer shall be liable for,the payment of maternity benefit at the rate of the average daily wage for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately following that day EXPLANATION For the purpose of this sub-section,the average daily wage means the average of the woman's wages payable to her for the days on which she has worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date from which she absents herself on account of maternity,or one rupee a day,whichever is higher No woman shall be entitled to maternity benefit unless she has actually worked in an establishment of the employer from whom she claims maternity benefit,for a period of not less than one hundred and sixty days in the twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery Provided that the qualifying period of one hundred and sixty days aforesaid shall not apply to a woman who has immigrated into the State of Assam and was pregnant at the time of the immigration For the purpose of calculating under this sub-section,the days on which a woman has actually worked in the establishment,the days for which she has been laid off during the period of twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery shall be taken into account The maximum period for which any woman shall be entitled to maternity benefit shall be twelve weeks,that is to say,six weeks up to and including the day of her delivery and six weeks immediately following that day Provided that where a woman dies during this period,the maternity benefit shall be payable only for the days up to and including the day of her death Provided further that where a woman,having delivered of a child,dies during her delivery or during the period of six weeks immediately following the date of her delivery,leaving behind in either case the child,the employer shall be liable for the maternity benefit for the entire period of six weeks immediately following the day of her delivery but if the child also dies during the said period,then,for the days upto and including the day of the death of the child S.6 of the Act which deals with notice of claim for maternity benefit and payment thereof is to the following effect :- \"6.Notice of claim for maternity benefit and payment thereof Any woman employed in an establishment and entitled to maternity benefit under the provisions of this Act may give notice in writing in such form as may be prescribed,to her employer,stating that her maternity benefit and any other amount to which she may be entitled under this Act may be paid to her or to such person as she may nominate in the notice and that she will not work in any establishment during the period for which she receives' maternity benefit In the case of a woman who is pregnant,such notice shall state the date from which she will be absent from work,not being a date earlier than six weeks from the date of her expected delivery 3) Any woman who has not given the notice when she was pregnant may give such notice as soon as possible after the delivery On receipt of the notice,the employer shall permit such woman to absent herself from the establishment until the expiry of six weeks after the day of her delivery The amount of maternity benefit for the period preceding the date of her expected delivery shall be paid in advance by the employer to the woman on production of such proof as may be prescribed that the woman is pregnant,and the amount due for the subsequent period shall be paid by the employer to.the woman within forty-eight hours of production of such proof as may be prescribed that the woman has been delivered of a child 6) The failure to give notice under this section s not disentitle a woman to maternity benefit or any other amount under this Act if she is otherwise entitled to such benefit or amount and in any such case,an Inspector may either of his own motion or on an application made to him by the woman,order the payment of such benefit of amount within such period as may be specified in the order The provisions of s.5 of the Act quoted above make it clear that a woman worker who expects a child is entitled to maternity benefit for a maximum period of twelve weeks which is split up into two periods viz.prenatal and post-natal The first one i.e.prenatal or ante-natal period is limited to the period of woman's actual absence extending upto six weeks immediately preceding and including the day on which her delivery occurs and the second one which is postnatal compulsory period consists of six weeks immediately following the day of delivery The benefit has to be calculated for the aforesaid two periods on the basis of the average daily wage According to the Explanation appended to s.5(1) of the Act,the average daily wage has to be computed taking into consideration the average of the woman's wager,.payable to her for the days on which she has worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date from which she absents herself on account of maternity,or one rupee a day,whichever is higher For fixing the average daily wage,it has therefore first to be ascertained whether the wages with were paid or were payable to the woman was for 'time work' or for 'piece work'.It has next to be ascertained as to what were the cash wages paid or payable to her in terms of the definition contained in s.3 (n) of the Act for the days on which she worked during the period of three-calendar months immediately preceding the date of delivery,reckoned according to the British calendar month The total wages thus worked out are to be divided by the number of days in the aforesaid three calendar months in order to arrive at the average daily wage After thus finding out the average daily wage,the liability of the employer in respect of the maternity benefit has to be calculated in terms of s.5 of the Act for both ore-natal and post-natal period indicated above The real though difficult question that calls for determination by us is as to what is the connotation of the term \"week\" occurring in sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act and whether the computation of the maternity benefit prescribed by the Act for the a foresaid two periods has to be made taking a \"week\" as signifying a cycle of seven days including a Sunday or a cycle of seven days minus a Sunday which is said to be a wageless day,As the Act does not contain any definition of the word \"week\",it has to be understood in its ordinary dictionary sense In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Third Edition),the word \"week\" has been described as meaning \"the cycle of seven days,recognized in the calendar of the Jews and thence adopted in the calendars of Christian Mohammedan and various other peoples A space of seven days,irrespective of the time from which it is reckoned Seven days as a term for periodical payments (of wager,,rent,or the like),or as a unit of reckoning for time of work or service In Webster's New World Dictionary (1962 Edition),the meaning of the word \"week\" is given as \"a period of seven days,especially one beginning with Sunday and ending with Saturday; the hours or days of work in a seven-day period In Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (Third Edition),it is stated that (1) \"though a week usually means any consecutive seven days,it will sometimes be interpreted to mean the ordinary notion of a week reckoning from Sunday to Sunday and (2) probably,a week usually means seven clear days A \"week\" according to Halsbury's Laws of England Third Edi-tion) Volume 37 at p.84 is.strictly the time between midnight on Saturday and the same hour on the next succeeding Saturday,but the term is also applied to any period of seven successive days Bearing in mind the above mentioned dictionary or popular meaning of the term week\",we think that in the context of sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act,the term has to be taken to signify a cycle of seven days including Sundays The language in which the aforesaid sub-s.s are couched also shows that the Legislature intended that computation of maternity benefit is to be made for the entire period of the woman worker's actual absence i.e.for all the days including Sundays which may be wageless holidays falling within that period and not only for intermittent periods of six days thereby excluding Sundays falling within that period for if it were not so,the Legislature instead of using the words \"for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and for the six weeks immediately following that day\" would have used the words \"for the working days falling within the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and the six weeks immediately following that day but excluding the wageless days\".Again the word \"period\" occurring in s.5(1) of the Act is a strong word It seems to emphasize,in our judgment,the continuous running of time and recurrence of the cycle of seven days It has also to be borne in mind in this connection that in interpreting provisions of beneficial pieces of legislation like the one in hand which is intended to achieve the object of doing social justice to women workers employed in the plantations and which squarely fall within the purview of Art.42 of the Constitution,the beneficent rule of construction which would enable the woman worker not only to subsist but also to make up her dissipated energy,nurse her child,preserve her efficiency as a worker and maintain the level of her previous efficiency and output has to be adopted by the Court The interpretation placed by us on the phraseology of sub-ss.(1) and (3) of s.5 of the Act appears to us to be in conformity not only with the legislative intendment but also with Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Art.4 of Convention No.103 concerning Maternity Protection Convention Revised),1952 adopted by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation which are extracted below for facility of reference:- \"Art.4 1.While absent from work on maternity leave in accordance with the provisions of art.3,the woman shall be entitled to receive cash and medical benefits 2.The rates of cash benefit shall be fixed by national laws or regulations so as to ensure benefit sufficient for the full and healthy maintenance of herself and her child in according with a suitable standard of living Thus we are of opinion that computation of maternity benefit has to be made for all the days including Sundays and rest days which may be wageless holidays comprised in the Actual period of absence of the woman extending upto six weeks preceding and including the day of delivery as also for all the days falling within the six weeks immediately following the day of delivery thereby ensuring that the woman worker gets for the said period not only the amount equalling 100 per cent of the wages which she was previously earning in terms of s.3 (n) of the Act but also the benefit of the wages for all the Sundays and rest days falling within the aforesaid two periods which would ultimately be conducive to the interests of both the woman worker and her employer In view of what we have stated above,we cannot uphold the view of the law expressed by the Full Bench of Kerala High Court in Malayalam Plantations Ltd Inspector of Plantations Mundakayam & Ors.1974 Indlaw KER 91 (supra In the result,the appeal fails and is hereby dismissed Although costs have to be paid by appellant to respondent No.2 in terms of the Court's order dated October 30,1975,yet in view of the fact that the said respondent has not chosen to appear at the hearing,of the case and Mr K.N.Bhat has assisted the Court as amicus curiae,we direct the appellant to pay Rs.1,000/-to Mr Bhat as his fee Appeal dismissed",

exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act,even then,this is not a fit case where this Court,in the exercise of its power u/art.136 of the Constitution would interfere with such an order of the High Court The appellants in this appeal,claiming to be the tenants of agricultural land,bearing Survey No.125/1,measuring 3 acres 11 Gunthas hereinafter called as the \"scheduled land\") situated in Lingabahalli Village,Madhugiri Taluk in the State of Karnataka,filed Form No.7 before the Land Tribunal praying for a declaration that they had acquired occupancy rights in respect of the scheduled land They alleged that they were cultivating the scheduled land from 1968 till the notified date under the Act on Wara basis giving 1/3rd of the share in the foodgrains to respondent No.4.Accordingly,the appellants prayed for an order of occupancy right in respect of the scheduled land alleging that they and their father were cultivating the scheduled land as occupancy right holders relying,inter alia,on the entries under the RTC record The case of the appellants,as made out,was disputed by the respondent No.4.The case of respondent No.4 was that the scheduled land was mortgaged to the 3rd respondent,Rajashankar,in the year 1968 and after the expiry of the said mortgage,the mortgagee was liable to deliver possession of the same The case of tenancy as made out by the appellants or their father was denied It was alleged by the respondent No.4 that since the respondent No.3 was a film actor and had settled in Madras (now Chennai),with the consent of the respondent No.3,the scheduled land was given to the father of the appellants and the father of the appellants was cultivating the same from the year 1968 but not as a tenant Accordingly,they prayed for rejection of the application filed by the father of the appellants claiming occupancy rights under the Act Initially,the Land Tribunal allowed the application of the father of the appellants and feeling aggrieved; a writ petition was filed against the said order The High Court had set aside the order of the Land Tribunal and remanded the case back to the Tribunal for a fresh decision The Land Tribunal,after remand,relying on the entries in the RTC record and some other materials on record,granted occupancy rights in favour of the appellants Feeling aggrieved,the respondent No.4 filed an appeal before the Appellate Authority,which was also dismissed A revision petition,thereafter,was moved before the High Court and the High Court,by the impugned judgment,had set aside the concurrent findings of fact and rejected the application filed by the father,since deceased,of the appellants holding,inter alia,that the appellants or their father had failed to prove the tenancy in respect of the scheduled land A special leave petition was filed against the judgment of the High Court,setting aside the concurrent orders allowing the application,in respect of which leave has already been granted We have heard Mr Raju,learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants and Mr S.N.Bhat,learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents We have examined the impugned judgment of the High Court as well as the orders of the Tribunals below It is true that the High Court,while exercising its revisional power under Section 121A of the Act,had set aside the concurrent findings of fact of the Land Tribunal as well as of the appellate authority,even then,examining the findings of the High Court and considering the power conferred on it in the revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act,we do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court in the exercise of our power u/art.136 of the Constitution While setting aside the findings of the Tribunal,the High Court,at paragraph 7 of the impugned judgment made the following findings: \"It is an undisputed fact that the revision petitioner has mortgaged the land in dispute in favour of the 5th respondent,Rajashankar in the year 1968 and after the expiry of the mortgage period,since the 5th respondent failed to deliver back the possession of the land in dispute to him,he filed the suit for redemption and obtained a decree for redemption When the matter stood thus,the father of the respondent Nos.3 and 4 Gondappa,who is the uncle of the 5th respondent,Rajashankar,filed Form No.7 before the Land Tribunal claiming occupancy rights in respect of the land in dispute contending that he is the tenant of the said land,under the 5th respondent from the year 1968,i.e.subsequent to the date of mortgage To prove this fact,he relied upon the entries in the R.T.C.extract for the years 1968 to 1974 wherein his name is shown as the person in cultivation of the land in dispute But,it is significant to note that the nature of cultivation of the land is not shown as that of a tenant in the said R.T.C.extracts In one year,the nature of cultivation is described as \"Swantha\"and in the years,the column is left blank Thus the R.T.C.extracts produced by him do not support his contention that he was cultivating the land in dispute as a tenant He has not produced any Geni receipts or any Lease Agreement to show that the 5th respondent has leased out the land in dispute in his favour on crop share basis and that he paid the Geni to the 5th respondent Thus,he has no documentary evidence in respect of his claim that he came in possession of the land in dispute as a tenant under the 5th respondent and that he was cultivating the land in dispute as a tenant It is further significant to note that in the evidence given by the respondent No.3 before the Land Tribunal,he claimed that his father has taken the land in dispute on lease in the year 1962,from the father of the petitioners,Gundu Rao Even in respect of the said claim,he failed to produce any documentary evidence evidencing the said lease of land in dispute from Gundu Rao On the other hand,in Form No.7 filed by Gondappa,the father of the respondents 3 and 4,he alleged that he was the tenant under the 5th respondent in respect of the land in dispute from the year 1968 Thus,there is no consistent stand regarding the year of commencement of tenancy or under whom,Gondappa,the father of the respondents 3 and 4 became the tenant So,the only question which arises for consideration is whether the said cultivation of the land in dispute by the father of the respondents 3 and 4 during the years 1968 to 1974 can be presumed to be that of a tenant under the provisions of S.4 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act S.4 of the Act makes it clear that a member of the owner's family cannot be considered as a deemed tenant,even if he is lawfully cultivating the land belonging to owner In the present case,since the father of the respondents 3 and 4,is the uncle of the respondent No.5,it cannot be said that he is not a member of the family of the respondent No.5 Though there is no evidence on record to show that there are any joint family properties belonging to the joint family of respondent No.5 and his uncle,there is nothing on record to show that they are not living as members of the joint family So,it is not possible to presume that the father of the respondent Nos.3 and 4 Gondappa,who is the uncle of respondent No.5 was not the member of the family of the mortgagee,respondent No.5 Again,the High Court,while setting aside the findings of fact also made the following findings: \"But in the instant case,since the respondents 3 and 4 failed to produce any evidence to show that their father was cultivating the land in dispute as a tenant under the 5th respondent mortgagee and even when the entries in the R.T.C.extract produced do not support the claim of tenancy set up by the father of the respondents 3 and 4,the question of drawing presumption of deemed tenancy in his favour under S.4 of the Act does not arise The father of the respondents 3 and 4,being the uncle of respondent No.5-Mortgagee,it is also quite possible that he might have been allowed to cultivate the land in dispute under the personal supervision of respondent No.5 by assisting him in cultivation of the said land In the present case also,the respondents 3 and 4 failed to prove that their father was cultivating the land in dispute from the year 1968 as a tenant under the respondent No.5 and that after the death of their father,they continued as tenants in respect of the land in dispute It is also significant to note that the respondent No.5,who was alive when the enquiry was pending before the Land Tribunal has not given evidence in favour of the respondents 3 and 4 stating that he has leased out the land in dispute in favour of the respondents 3 and 4.Except the interested testimony of respondents 3 and 4,there is nothing else on record to show that their father was inducted as a tenant to cultivate the land in dispute by the 5th respondent after the land is dispute was taken on mortgage by him So,it is not possible to presume that the father of the respondents 3 and 4 was inducted as a tenant by the mortgagee,the 5th respondent,in respect of the land in dispute Since the respondents 3 and 4 failed to produce any documentary evidence to show that their father was put in possession of the land in dispute by the 5th respondent,mortgagee as a 'tenant' and that they are continuing as tenants in respect of the said land after the death of their father,I find that they are not entitled to grant of occupational rights The earlier decision of this Court reported in ILR 1996 KAR page 2340 that when a person fails to prove that he is cultivating the land as tenant,he cannot be granted occupational right notwithstanding the fact that he might be in possession of the land and cultivating the same,is applicable to the facts of the present case on all fours From a careful examination of the findings given by the High Court,as quoted hereinabove,in upsetting the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Tribunals below,we are not in a position to hold that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the concurrent orders of the Tribunals below in the exercise of its revisional power under Section 121A of the Act The power conferred on the High Court to revise the orders of the tribunals below has been provided in Section 121A of the Act,which runs as under: \"The High Court may at any time call for the records of any order or proceeding recorded by the Appellate authority under this Act or any other law for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality of such order or as to the regularity of such proceeding and may pass such order with respect thereto as it thinks fit From a plain reading of Section 121A of the Act,under which revisional jurisdiction can be exercised,it would be clear that the High Court,while exercising such power is entitled to re-appreciate the evidence when it finds that the conclusion arrived at by the appellate authority runs contrary to the materials on record and when it finds that there is no evidence to support the conclusion of the appellate authority or when it finds that the reasons given by the appellate authority are absolutely perverse and cannot be supported by the evidence on record It would also be clear from a plain reading of Section 121A of the Act that the High Court is also entitled to interfere with the orders of the Tribunals below when the material evidence on record was ignored or a finding was such that no court would come to such conclusion or that the decision of the Tribunals below was manifestly unjust We have carefully examined the provisions under Section 121A of the Act,which is the revisional power under the Act,and also the provisions u/s.115 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short \"the Code\").So far as S.115 of the Code is concerned,it has been made clear that it is only in case of a jurisdictional error or when the courts below had acted with material irregularity in the exercise of their jurisdiction that the question of interfering with such an order can arise,otherwise,the High Court is not entitled to interfere with any other order which does not satisfy the conditions laid down for interference u/s.115 of the Code On the other hand,in our view,under Section 121A of the Act,it would be open to the High Court to interfere with the orders of the tribunals below as the High Court is empowered to look into the legality of the order or regularity of the proceedings although,in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction u/s.115 of the Code,the High Court is not entitled to look into the legality of the order or the regularity of the proceedings but only entitled to interfere with the orders of the Tribunals or the courts below when it finds that they have a) exercised a jurisdiction not vested in them by law,or b) failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested,or c) acted in the exercise of their jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity Reading the aforesaid provisions viz.,Section 121A of the Act and S.115 of the Code,we have no hesitation in our mind to hold that the revisional power exercised by the High Court under section 121A of the Act is wider than the one exercised by the High Court in its revisional jurisdiction u/s.115 of the Code As noted herein earlier,since section 121A of the Act clearly empowers the High Court to look into the legality of the orders impugned,therefore,it would be open to the High Court to consider the material evidence on record,when it finds that such evidence was not at all considered by the tribunals below or when the conclusion arrived at by the tribunals below run contrary to the materials on record or when it finds that there is no evidence to support the conclusion of the tribunals below or that the reasons given by the tribunals below are absolutely perverse or a finding was such that no court would come to such a conclusion or that the decisions of the tribunals below were manifestly unjust Therefore,under section 121A of the Act,in the presence of any of the abovementioned circumstances,the High Court is empowered to look into the legality of the orders impugned in deciding the question whether the appellants could be held to be the tenants under the respondent Nos.3 or 4 Keeping the aforesaid principles in mind as to when the High Court would be justified,in the exercise of its power under Section 121A of the Act,to examine the legality of the orders of the tribunals below in an appropriate case,let us now examine the findings of the High Court,while setting aside the concurrent findings of fact of the Tribunals below In our view,on a careful examination of the findings of the High Court,which were based on consideration of the material evidence on record,it is difficult for us to hold that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the concurrent findings of fact of the tribunals below in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act We have already noted the findings made by the High Court in the impugned judgment on the question whether the appellants could be held to be the tenants on the evidence and materials on record While doing so,in our view,the High Court was justified in coming to the conclusion that the evidence and material on record would clearly establish that the appellants were not able to prove that they were the tenants in respect of the scheduled land under the respondents One of the main criteria for deciding whether a particular person is a tenant or not is to see whether there was payment of rent,either in cash or in kind In this case,while rejecting the claim of the appellants,the High Court had considered that the appellants had failed to satisfy the court that any payment of rent was made either by the father of the appellants or by the appellants themselves The tribunals below,while accepting the case of the appellants,had relied on the entries made in the RTC record in respect of certain period While considering such entries,the High Court had rightly held that from the entries in the RTC record for the years 1968 to 1974,the name of the appellants was not shown as the person in cultivation of the land in dispute and also the nature of cultivation of the scheduled land was not shown as that of the tenants in the said RTC record That being the position,the High Court had come to a proper conclusion that the entries in the RTC extracts produced by the appellants could not support the contention that they were cultivating the land in dispute as the tenants In our view also,the High Court was fully justified in drawing an adverse inference against the appellants for not producing any Geni receipts or any lease agreement to show that the 5th respondent before the High Court (respondent No.3 herein) had,in fact,leased out the scheduled land in favour of the appellants or their father,since deceased,on crop share basis and that the appellants had paid the Geni to the 5th respondent Such being the findings arrived at by the High Court with which we are in concurrence,it is difficult to hold that the tenancy claimed by the appellants in respect of the scheduled land could be established Considering the above aspect of the matter and after considering the scope of Section 121A of the Act,we are,therefore,unable to agree with the learned counsel for the appellants that in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act,the High Court was not entitled to set aside the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the appellate authority and the land tribunal Such being the position,we do not find any reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court,although the High Court,in the exercise of its power under Section 121A of the Act,had set aside the concurrent orders of the appellate authority as well as the land tribunal Mr Raju,the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants,however,contended before us that it was not open to the High Court,in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act,to interfere with the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the appellate authority and the Land Tribunal In support of his contention,he had relied on a decision of this Court in the case of Dahya Lal & Ors.vs Rasul Mohammed Abdul Rahim [1963 (3) SCR 1].1962 Indlaw SC 366 He also relied on a decision of this Court in the case of Mohan Balaku Patil & Ors.vs Krishnoji Bhaurao Hundre (Dead By Lrs.[(2000) 1 SCC 518] 1999 Indlaw SC 941 and Krishtappa Yellappa Pujar & Ors.vs Ram Samsthan Beladhadi [(1999) 1 SCC 74].1998 Indlaw SC 1197 In our view,so far as the decision in the case of Mohan Balaku Patil & Ors.vs By Lrs.[(2000) 1 SCC 518] 1999 Indlaw SC 941 is concerned,it is difficult to conceive how this decision could be of any help to the appellants In that case,the findings recorded by the appellate authority as affirmed by the High Court by placing reliance on the entries made in the record of rights to the effect that the appellants were not in possession of the land on the relevant date nor were they cultivating the same,were not accepted by this court In any view of the matter,in that decision,relying on the aforesaid findings,this Court also had set aside the order made by the appellate authority as affirmed by the High Court in revision and restored the order made by the land tribunal If that case is of any help to the facts of the present case,it would be in favour of the respondents So far as Krishtappa Yellapa Pujar & Ors.vs Ram Samsthan Beladhadi [(1999) 1 SCC 74] is concerned,we again fail to understand that how this could be of any help to the appellants In that decision,it has been made clear that the High Court was entitled to interfere with the orders of the appellate authority only on question of law or irregularity in procedure and on no other aspect In our view,we have already held that the High Court was entitled to interfere with the concurrent orders of the tribunals below as material evidence on record was not considered at all and non consideration of the material evidence on record is a question of law and,therefore,the High Court was entitled to interfere Accordingly,this decision is of no help to the appellants Lastly,in our view,in view of the discussion made herein above,the decision relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant in the case of Dahya Lal & Ors.vs Rasul Mohammed Abdul Rahim [1963 (3) SCR 1 1962 Indlaw SC 366] need not be discussed There is another aspect of this matter Even assuming that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the concurrent findings of fact in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act,then also,we are of the view that it is not a fit case where this Court should interfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court in the exercise of our power u/art.136 of the Constitution In Union of India & Ors.vs Gangadhar Narsingdas Aggarwal & Anr.[(1997) 10 SCC 305],1995 Indlaw SC 1227 this Court,while declining to interfere with the order of the High Court in the exercise of its power u/art.136 of the Constitution,held that even if two views are possible,the view taken by the High Court being a plausible one,it would not call for intervention by this Court u/art.136 of the Constitution Considering the concurrent orders of the appellate authority and the land tribunal and the impugned order of the High Court,we are in agreement with the High Court because the view taken by it was plausible and therefore,the question of interference by us u/art.136 of the Constitution is not warranted Again in Jai Mangal Oraon vs Mira Nayak (Smt.) & Ors.[(2000) 5 SCC 141 2000 Indlaw SC 332,this Court had laid down that when there was nothing illegal and wrong in the reasoning and conclusions arrived at by the High Court and the same appeared to be well merited and in accordance with the interpretation of statutory provisions,this Court would not interfere with the order of the High Court u/art.136 of the Constitution We have already considered the findings made by the High Court while setting aside the concurrent orders of the tribunals below and found that the same appear to be well merited and in accordance with the material evidence on record,therefore,this Court would not interfere with the order of the High Court u/art.136 of the Constitution Finally in Taherakhatoon (D) By Lrs Vs Salambin Mohammad [(1992) 2 SCC 635 1992 Indlaw SC 355],this Court at paragraph 20 has observed as follows : \"In view of the above decisions,even though we are now dealing with the appeal after grant of special leave,we are not bound to go into merits and even if we do so and declare the law or point out the error still we may not interfere if the justice of the case on facts does not require interference or if we feel that the relief could be moulded in a different fashion In view of the aforesaid,we are,therefore,of the view that this is not a fit case where this Court shall interfere with the order passed by the High Court under Section 121A of the Act.19.For the reasons aforesaid,this appeal fails and is dismissed without any order as to costs Appeal dismissed",
