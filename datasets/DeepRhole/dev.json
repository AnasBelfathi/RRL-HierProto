    "data": "Challenge in this appeal is to the order of a Division Bench of Madras High Court allowing the appeal filed by the respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused').The accused was convicted for offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code,1860 (in short the 'IPC') and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-with default stipulation by Principal District Judge,Madurai He was also convicted for offences punishable under Section 392 read with Section 397 IPC and sentence to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine Background facts in a nutshell are as follows The deceased is one Mayurani,a Sri Lankan student,who was residing in the first floor of the house belonging to one Solsimalai (P.W.1).The Accused is also a Sri Lankan student studying in a different college,but staying in the second floor of the same premises The occurrence allegedly took place in the afternoon of 22.4.2003 The First Information Report was lodged by P.W.1 on 24-4-2003 at about 9.30 A.M.It was indicated in the First Information Report that on 24.4.2003 at 9.00 A.M.,while the informant had gone to perform pooja in the first floor of the house,he got foul smell in the last room of the first floor and found blood seeping through the front door On opening the window he noticed that Mayurani was lying in a pool of blood with her face covered with a bag On the basis of the aforesaid F.I.R.,investigation was taken up initially by P.W.40 Subsequently on the basis of the order of the High Court,such investigation was completed by P.W.42.The accused is stated to have been arrested on suspicion on 26.4.2003.On the basis of the statement of the accused,prosecution discovered many materials including a knife and a log allegedly used for killing Initially,P.W.40 suspected the role of P.W.1,his wife P.W.2,P.W.3,from whose house certain incriminating material were recovered allegedly on the basis of statement of the accused as well as P.W.4,who was working as a cleaner in the vehicle of P.W.1.Subsequently,however,P.W.42,who took over investigation from P.W.40 filed charge-sheet only against the present appellant on the footing that P.Ws.1 to 4 had no role to play in the crime The prosecution relied upon only circumstantial evidence,namely,confessional statements of the accused leading to recovery of various incriminating materials Ex.P-6 is the statement leading to recovery of Travel bags (M.Os.2 & 3),knife (.M.0.5),wooden log (M.0.28),rubber gloves (M.0.29 series) cotton rope with human hair (MN.O.30 series),two sponges soaked with blood (M.0.31 series),bloodstained blue clolour jean pant (M.0.32),bloodstained white banian (M.0.33),colour banian (M.0.34),bloodstained grey colour pant (M.0.35),bloodstained pillow (M.0.36),plastic bucket (M.0.37) from the house of P.W.3.Ex-P-8 is the statement leading to recovery of computer and its accessories (M.Os.6 to 17) from the house of P.W.15,a classmate of the accused Ex.P-10 is the statement relating to jewelleries,ultimately leading to recovery of gold ingots (M.O.18 series) from the house of P.W.19 on the basis of other connecting statements of P.W.17 and P.W.18.These three statements,Exs P-6,P-8 and P-10 dated 26-4-2003,were made before P.W.40 in the presence of P.W.22 and C.W.1.The other confessional statement Ex.P-12 dated 22-9-2003 made before P.W.42 and Subbiah and P.W.24,led to recovery of \"M\" dollar (M.0.38) and key chain with key chain in (M.0.39) from the toilet in the room of the accused The prosecution has also relied upon the alleged motive to the effect that the accused urgently wanted money with a view to increase his marks in Mathematics and,therefore,the accused had stolen articles belonging to the deceased The trial court found the respondent guilty and recorded conviction and imposed sentence as aforestated The trial court found that the prosecution version rested on circumstantial evidence The following circumstances were highlighted to find the accused guilty a The death is homicidal; (b The accused was in need of money to chase mathematics paper and for the aforesaid purpose he has killed the deceased to take away the valuable articles like computer and gold ornaments to sell such articles in the market c At the time of occurrence,only the accused,deceased and PW 9 were available in the premises and there was no other person d) Statement of the accused leading to recovery of incriminating materials such as knife,rope,clothes,wooden log and other valuable articles such as computer,gold ornaments,\"M Dollar and the key chain with key belonging to the deceased The High Court found that the circumstances highlighted were not sufficient to fasten the guilt on the accused,and directed acquittal Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the High Court failed to notice that the circumstances highlighted clearly establish the chain of circumstances which established the prosecution version and the High Court was not justified in directing acquittal Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the judgment of the High Court The conviction based on circumstantial evidence has been highlighted by this Court in various orders of this Court It has been consistently laid down by this Court that where a case rests squarely on circumstantial evidence,the inference of guilt can be justified only when all the incriminating facts and circumstances are found to be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or the guilt of any other person.(See Hukam Singh v State of Rajasthan AIR (1977 SC 1063 1977 Indlaw SC 433); Eradu and Ors.v State of Hyderabad (AIR 1956 SC 316 1955 Indlaw SC 108); Earabhadrappa v State of Karnataka (AIR 1983 SC 446 1983 Indlaw SC 161); State of U.P.v Sukhbasi and Ors.(AIR 1985 SC 1224 1985 Indlaw SC 71); Balwinder Singh v State of Punjab (AIR 1987 SC 350 1986 Indlaw SC 35); Ashok Kumar Chatterjee v State of M.P.(AIR 1989 SC 1890 1989 Indlaw SC 443).The circumstances from which an inference as to the guilt of the accused is drawn have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and have to be shown to be closely connected with the principal fact sought to be inferred from those circumstances In Bhagat Ram v State of Punjab (AIR 1954 SC 621 1954 Indlaw SC 188),it was laid down that where the case depends upon the conclusion drawn from circumstances the cumulative effect of the circumstances must be such as to negative the innocence of the accused and bring the offences home beyond any reasonable doubt We may also make a reference to a decision of this Court in C.Chenga Reddy and Ors.v State of A.P.(1996) 10 SCC 193 1996 Indlaw SC 3059,wherein it has been observed thus In a case based on circumstantial evidence,the settled law is that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be fully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature Moreover,all the circumstances should be complete and there should be no gap left in the chain of evidence Further the proved circumstances must be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and totally inconsistent with his innocence In Padala Veera Reddy v State of A.P.and Ors.(AIR 1990 SC 79 1989 Indlaw SC 31),it was laid down that when a case rests upon circumstantial evidence,such evidence must satisfy the following tests: \"(1) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn,must be cogently and firmly established; (2) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused; (3) the circumstances,taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else; and (4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence In State of U.P.v Ashok Kumar Srivastava,(1992 Crl LJ 1104 1992 Indlaw SC 107),it was pointed out that great care must be taken in evaluating circumstantial evidence and if the evidence relied on is reasonably capable of two inferences,the one in favour of the accused must be accepted It was also pointed out that the circumstances relied upon must be found to have been fully established and the cumulative effect of all the facts so established must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt Sir Alfred Wills in his admirable book \"Wills' Circumstantial Evidence\" (Chapter VI) lays down the following rules specially to be observed in the case of circumstantial evidence: (1) the facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved and beyond reasonable doubt connected with the factum probandum; (2) the burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact,which infers legal accountability; (3) in all cases,whether of direct or circumstantial evidence the best evidence must be adduced which the nature of the case admits; (4) in order to justify the inference of guilt,the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation,upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt, (5) if there be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused,he is entitled as of right to be acquitted There is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch-stone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by the this Court as far back as in 1952 In Hanumant Govind Nargundkar and Anr V.State of Madhya Pradesh,(AIR 1952 SC 343 1952 Indlaw SC 89),wherein it was observed thus: \"It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be in the first instance be fully established and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused Again,the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved In other words,there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused A reference may be made to a later decision in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v State of Maharashtra,(AIR 1984 SC 1622 1984 Indlaw SC 432).Therein,while dealing with circumstantial evidence,it has been held that onus was on the prosecution to prove that the chain is complete and the infirmity of lacuna in prosecution cannot be cured by false defence or plea The conditions precedent in the words of this Court,before conviction could be based on circumstantial evidence,must be fully established They are: (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established The circumstances concerned must or should and not may be established; (2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused,that is to say,they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty; (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency; (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved; and (5) there must be a chain of evidence so compete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused These aspects were highlighted in State of Rajasthan v Rajaram (2003(8) SCC 180 2003 Indlaw SC 630),State of Haryana v Jagbir Singh & Anr.(2003(11) SCC 261 2003 Indlaw SC 807 The main circumstances relied upon by the prosecution relates to the statements of the accused leading to discovery of materials facts,admissible under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act,1872 (in short the 'Evidence Act Law is well settled that the prosecution while relying upon the confessional statement leading to discovery of articles under Section 27 of the Evidence Act,has to prove through cogent evidence that the statement has been made voluntarily and leads to discovery of the relevant facts The scope and ambit of Section 27 of the Evidence Act had been stated and restated in several decisions of this Court However,in almost all such decisions reference is made to the observation of the Privy Council in Pulukuri Kotayya v Emperor (AIR 1947 PC 67 1946 Indlaw PC 23).It is worthwhile to extract such quoted observation: \"It is fallacious to treat the 'fact discovered' within the section as equivalent to the object produced; the fact discovered embraces the place from which the object is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this and the information given must relate distinctly to this fact Information as to past user or the past history,of the object produced is not related to his discovery in the setting in which it is discovered Information supplied by a person in custody that 'I will produce a knife concealed in the roof of my house' does not lead to the discovery of the knife; knives were discovered many years ago It leads to the discovery of the fact that a knife is concealed in the house of the informant to his knowledge,and if the knife is proved to have been used in the commission of the offence,the fact discovered is very relevant But if to the statement the words be added 'with which stabbed A',these words are inadmissible since they do not related to the discovery of the knife in the house of the informant At one time it was held that the expression \"fact discovered\" in the section is restricted to a physical or material fact which can be perceived by the senses,and that it does not include a mental fact,now it is fairly settled that the expression \"fact discovered\" includes not only the physical object produced,but also the place from which it is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this,as noted in Pulukuri Kottaya's case 1946 Indlaw PC 23 (supra The various requirements of the section can be summed up as follows The fact of which evidence is sought to be given must be relevant to the issue It must be borne in mind that the provision has nothing to do with the question of relevancy The relevancy of the fact discovered must be established according to the prescriptions relating to relevancy of other evidence connecting it with the crime in order to make the fact discovered admissible The fact must have been discovered The discovery must have been in consequence of some information received from the accused and not by the accused's own act The person giving the information must be accused of any offence He must be in the custody of a police officer The discovery of a fact in consequence of information received from an accused in custody must be deposed to 7) Thereupon only that portion of the information which relates distinctly or strictly to the fact discovered can be proved The rest is inadmissible As observed in Pulukuri Kottaya's case 1946 Indlaw PC 23 (supra) it can seldom happen that information leading to the discovery of a fact forms the foundation of the prosecution case It is one link in the chain of proof and the other links must be forged in a manner allowed by law To similar effect was the view expressed in K.Chinnaswamy Reddy v State of A.P.(AIR 1962 SC 1788 1962 Indlaw SC 192 The above position was highlighted in Anter Singh v State of Rajasthan (AIR 2004 SC 2665 2004 Indlaw SC 79 In Rammi alias Rameshwar v State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1999 SC 3544 1999 Indlaw SC 1512) the scope and ambit of Section 27 of the Evidence Act was analysed in great detail and it was concluded in para 12 as follows: \" True,such information is admissible in evidence under Section 27 of the Evidence Act,but admissibility alone would not render the evidence,pertaining to the above information,reliable While testing the reliability of such evidence the court has to see whether it was voluntarily stated by the accused Significantly,the prosecution has relied upon the evidence of PW 40 who was investigating initially His evidence has to be considered in the background of what has been stated by PW 22 and CW 1.It has been accepted by the prosecution that great efforts were made by PW 40 to falsely implicate to PWs 1 to 4 and for that purpose a departmental proceeding was initiated Even according to the statement of the subsequent investigating officer (PW 42),several blank papers with the signature of PW 22 and CW 1 had been by PW 40 and such documents had been used to create false records to implicate PWs 1 to 4.It is to be noted that PW 2 himself was one of the suspected person at the initial stage of investigation That apart,materials on record such as the statement of P.W.22 recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973 in short 'the Code') and the statement of C.W.1,raise a reasonable doubt relating to voluntariness of the alleged confession P.W.22,who is a close relation of the deceased (cousin) has stated that two days after the occurrence after the information that Bala Prasanna was roaming near LIC Colony,Anna Nagar Police brought him to the Police Station and Bala Prasanna was arrested at 5.00 P.M.and was taken to the police station and a witness was present there It is further stated that at the time of enquiry,the accused was beaten up by the police and they have seized a gold ring and Rs.5000/-cash from him If this is the statement of P.W.22 recorded under Section 164 of the Code a witness in whose presence the confessional statement leading to discovery of articles from the house of Hajeeali,P.W.3 had been made,it raises serious doubt regarding the voluntariness of the statement In this context,it is also note worthy to indicate that C.W.1 in his evidence has stated that the accused was in police station on 24-4-2003 itself Similar statement is made by P.W.4.That apart,C.W.1 has stated that no statement has been made in his presence The prosecution version to the effect that even some signatures on blank papers had been taken from P.W.22 and C.W.1 thus assumes great importance The alleged statement made by the accused led to discovery of knife,bloodstained clothes,rope,etc Unfortunately,for the prosecution there is no evidence to show that in fact the wearing apparels containing bloodstains belonged to the accused,save and except the alleged confessional statement No witness has spoken that those clothes were worn by the accused at any time far less at or about the time of occurrence It is also to be kept in view that those articles were recovered from the house of P.W.3 and at the initial stage of investigation,P.W.3 himself was one of the suspected person and he was arrested Therefore,the statement of P.W.3 and his mother that those articles were brought by the accused and left in the upstairs room is to be considered with a pinch of salt Moreover,there is nothing to indicate that in fact the bloodstained clothes and rope had tallied with the blood grouping of the deceased The knife did not contain any bloodstain Therefore,the aspect relating to recovery of articles from the house of P.W.3 and his mother cannot be considered as a link to complete the chain of circumstantial evidence The next recovery relates to recovery of computer and accessories Apart from the fact that there is niggling doubt about the so called confession,in view of statement under Section 164 of the Code of P.W.22 and the statement of C.W.1,a further doubt is raised regarding such aspect in view of evidence of C.W.1 to the effect that he had seen such computer in the room of the deceased when they had gone to the room after the offence was reported The fact that C.W.1 is a close relation of the deceased adds weight to his evidence rather than taking it away Even accepting that the computer had been given to P.W.15 by the accused,such circumstance by itself does not unerringly points towards the guilt of the accused either in respect of offence of murder or even robbery It is quite possible that such articles might have been borrowed by the accused from the deceased and not necessarily stolen by the accused from the deceased after killing her The fact that P.W.9 had not initially stated anything before P.W.40 about the accused coming down with computer at 3.30 P.M.and stated so for the first time when she was re-examined after 5 months cannot be lost sight of As a matter of fact,P.W.9 who was examined on the very date when police started investigation did not inform the police that she had seen the accused coming down from upstairs or that the accused had threatened her Her statement to the following: \"I did not tell anyone that Balaprasanna took away the computer and threatened me I did not tell this even to the Inspector of Police after going to the police station I do not tell this even to P.W.1 The next recovery relates to the ingots For the aforesaid aspect,the evidence of P.Ws.17,18 and 19 is relevant Since the golden jewellery had been molten and were recovered in the shape of ingots,it would be very hazardous to come to the conclusion that in fact the golden jewellery belonged to the deceased If the accused had killed the deceased and stolen those golden jewellery,there is no reason as to why he had also not taken ear rings from the deceased The fact that ear rings were on the dead body is admitted by the prosecution The prosecution has strongly relied upon the fact that \"M\" Dollar belonging to the deceased and a chain with key of the room of the deceased were discovered from inside the toilet in the room which was previously occupied by the accused For the aforesaid purpose,they have relied upon the evidence of P.W.42 and the seizure witness P.W.24.The accused had allegedly made earlier confessional statement before P.W.40 on 26-4-2003 leading to discovery of several articles The subsequent statement spoken to by P.W.42,the subsequent Investigating Officer,is alleged to have been made only in September,2003,after about five months So far as the first confession statement made before P.W.40 is concerned,admittedly the accused was under physical custody,at that time,whereas at the time of last confession stated to have been made before P.W.42,the accused was on bail and he had been summoned by P.W.42 for further examination and,therefore,technically in custody If the accused had not made such a statement at such first instance,when he had confessed about other articles,it is not understood as to how after 5 months when he was on bail he would make such a statement Such alleged confession made belatedly thus creates doubt regarding its authenticity or voluntariness In this context,it is to be noted that C.W.1 states that \"M\" Dollar was taken from him by P.W.42 for the purpose of facilitating investigation Keeping in view the fact that C.W.1 is a close relation of the deceased and obviously interested in punishing the real culprit,such a statement coming from C.W.1 cannot be slightly brushed aside The fact that there had been a statement allegedly made by P.W.1 leading to recovery of a parallel key from the dash board of the car of P.W.1,cannot be lost sight of It is of course true that the prosecution has tried to exonerate P.W.1 by adducing evidence through P.Ws.36 and 39 to the effect that immediately after recovery of the dead body,P.W.40 had taken two such keys,thus contradicting the alleged confession of P.W.1.However,the very suspicious role of P.W.40,who apparently was in possession of at least two keys of the same lock creates suspicion regarding recovery of another key after 5 months Law is well settled that when the prosecution relies upon circumstantial evidence,all the links in the chain of circumstances must be complete and should be proved through cogent evidence When the judgment of the High Court is analysed in the background of what has been stated by this Court as regards circumstantial evidence,the inevitable conclusion is that the impugned judgment of the High Court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference The appeal is dismissed Appeal dismissed",

upholding a judgment and order of a learned Single Judge of the said Court dated 19.02.1999 in C.R.Nos.324,1012,568,1022 and 1023 of 1998 One Shri A.J.Tayeng was the Revenue Commissioner of Government of Manipur The State of Manipur had not framed any recruitment rules for appointment inter alia in the Revenue Department and in particular the field staff thereof The Commissioner of Revenue Department was conferred with a power of being the cadre controlling authority for non-ministerial post of the Revenue Department He was also to be the Chairman of the Departmental Promotion Committee for non-ministerial post of the Revenue Department The Commissioner allegedly made certain appointments in the posts of Mandols,Process-Servers and Zilladars which was not within the knowledge of the State The said appointments were made on temporary basis Appointments were made on 11.09.1997,22.11.1997 and 5.12.1997.A sample copy of the offer of appointment reads as under: \"No.1/14/97 Com (Rev): On the recommendation of D.P.C.and under the directives issued by the Hon'ble Gauhati High Court,the following persons are hereby appointed as Mandols on temporary basis in the scale of pay of Rs.950-20-1150-EB-25-1400/-per month with usual allowances against thereto existing clear vacancies of Mandals under Revenue Department from the date of their joining on duties 2.Further,they are posted at the places indicate against their names:- 3.The expenditure is debitable under Appropriate Heads of Accounts of the Departments/ Offices concerned No record in regard to the said recruitments was maintained An inquiry was,therefore,made to find out the authority which had issued the said offers of appointments Shri Tayeng by a UO Note dated 12.01.1998 denied to have made such an appointment stating: \"CONFIDENTIAL U.O.No.2/15/93-Com (R) Pt Imphal,the 12th Jan.,1998 Sub: Submission of report With reference to the U.O.letter No.2/15/93 Com(R Pt Dated 6th January,1998 regarding the alleged appointment of ad-hoc/ regular appointment to the post of Lambus/ Mandols etc.of the Hon'ble Minister (Revenue),I am to say that I am not all aware of such appointments made by me except for 3 Lambus who were kept in panel for appointment,and accordingly the S.O.(Revenue Shri Robert Shaiza was instructed to take care I,therefore,deny making of such appointments On the other hand,Md A.R.Khan,Secretary (Revenue) has made many appointments of Mandols/ Process Servers/ Zilladars in the recent months against which I have been complaining that the Secretary (Revenue) has no power or authority to make any appointments of field staff as per Rules provided under M.L.R.Act,1960.In this regard,I have apprised the matter to the Hon'ble Minister (Revenue) already and also informed the Chief Secretary,Manipur explaining that the Secretary (Revenue) cannot make such appointments of field staffs,even if he wanted to do so,all the relevant files should have been routed through the undersigned so that the same may be brought to the notice of the Hon'ble Minister (Revenue).His action has created lots of misunderstanding and confusion He has been making false and wrong allegations against the Commissioner (Revenue) and putting him false position It is for this reason,I have been writing to all the Deputy Commissioners in the Districts even by sending W/T messages clarifying the actual position of making any appointment of Revenue field staff I still deny that I have made any appointment of field staffs of Revenue Department during the recent months Submitted for information and consideration Sd/-12/1/98 (Annayok J.Tayeng Commissioner (Revenue Govt.of Manipur,Minister (Revenue In view of the aforementioned stand taken by the said Shri Tayeng,the offers of appointment issued in favour of the Respondents were cancelled by an order dated 17.02.1998.A corrigendum thereto was,however,issued on 21.02.1998 stating: \"No.2/15/93-Com(Rev Temp-I: Please read as \"August/97\" in place of \"October/97\" occurring in the 4th line of this Government order No.2/15/93 Com(Rev Temp-I dated 17-2-1998 In Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.19375-19376 of 2005,the respondents were appointed on ad hoc basis for a period of six months Their appointments were also cancelled on similar grounds The respondents herein filed writ petitions before the High Court on 4.06.1998 questioning the said order of cancellation of their appointments The said Shri Tayeng retired on 28.02.1998.Despite the fact that he,in his UO Note dated 12.02.1998 addressed to the Minister of Revenue,denied to have made any appointment,when approached by the writ petitioners respondents,he affirmed in their support an affidavit in the High Court stating: \"3.That,while I was functioning as Revenue Commissioner,Manipur,matters relating to appointment on the recommendation of the D.P.C.,transfer etc.were put-up to me in files and I used to pass order on the basis of facts presented to me in file I also issued appointment order under my signature After my retirement from service I have no access to such files As stated above,I was transferred and posted to the Manipur Electronics Development Corporation during 1997 4.That after my retirement,some of the writ petitioners civil Rule No.568 of 1998,came to me and show copy of the writ petition and the counter affidavit of the respondent No.1,2 and 3.I have gone through the copy of the writ petition and the counter-affidavit and annexures thereto The Xerox copy of the cyclostyled appointment order bearing No.1/14/97 Com (Rev.) dated 11.9.97 (annexure A/1 to the writ petition) appointing 3 persons to the post of Mandol and No.1/14/97 Com.(Rev dated 11.9.97 (Annexure A/2 to the writ petition) appointing 4 persons to the post of Mandol,are perused by me minutely I submit that these appointment orders (annexures A/1 and A/2) bear my signature (initial) and appear to have been issued under my signature It appears that the appointment orders were issued after complying the formalities prescribed there for which can be ascertained from the relevant official file Since I have retired from service,I have no access to the file and do not know what might have been in the file and where is the file Verified that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and no part of it is false The writ petitions filed by the respondents herein were allowed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court opining: (i The principles of natural justice having not been complied with,the impugned orders cannot be sustained ii Whereas,in the impugned order,the appointments of the respondents were said to have been passed without the knowledge of the Administrative Department (Revenue Department); in the counter affidavit,it was stated that no records were available in respect thereof and,thus,the said plea being inconsistent with each other,the orders of cancellation of appointment would be bad in law in the light of a decision of this Court in Mohinder Singh Gill and Anr.v Chief Election Commissioner,Delhi and Ors.[AIR 1978 SC 851  1977 Indlaw SC 53 However,it was observed: \"However,it is further made clear that the State respondent are at liberty to initiate or take up any appropriate legal action in the matter pertaining to their alleged fake appointments in their respective posts in accordance with law and pass necessary order after affording reasonable opportunity of being heard to them iii So far as the matter relating to Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.19375-19376 of 2005 is concerned,it was directed that as the appointment of the respondents were made for a period of six months,the employees were only entitled to the salary for the said period The writ appeals preferred there against by the appellants herein were dismissed Mr Jaideep Gupta,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants,would submit that the High Court went wrong in passing the impugned judgment insofar as it failed to take into consideration that in a case of this nature it was not necessary to comply with the principles of natural justice Strong reliance in this behalf has been placed on Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and Others v Ajay Kumar Das and Others [(2002) 4 SCC 503  2002 Indlaw SC 287 It was argued that the question,as to whether appointments were made without the knowledge of the Department or for that matter whether any record was available there for was of not much significance as in effect and substance they lead to the same inference and in that view of the matter,the decision of this Court in Mohinder Singh Gill 1977 Indlaw SC 53 (supra) was not attracted S.B.Sanyal,learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents,on the other hand,would submit that the question as to whether the appointments of the respondents were nullities or not having not been raised before the High Court,this Court should not permit the appellants to raise the said contention at this stage The learned counsel would submit that even in a case of this nature,it was incumbent upon the appellants to comply with the principles of natural justice Strong reliance in this behalf has been placed on Parshotam Lal Dhingra v Union of India AIR 1958 SC 36  1957 Indlaw SC 103],Murugayya Udayar and Another v Kothampatti Muniyandavar Temple by Trustee Pappathi Ammal 1991 Supp (1) SCC 331  1991 Indlaw SC 904] and Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and Others v State of U.P.and Others [(1991) 1 SCC 212  1990 Indlaw SC 463 The State while offering appointments,having regard to the constitutional scheme adumbrated in Arts.14 and 16 of the Constitution of India,must comply with its constitutional duty,subject to just and proper exceptions,to give an opportunity of being considered for appointment to all persons eligible there for The posts of field staffs of the Revenue Department of the State of Manipur were,thus,required to be filled up having regard to the said constitutional scheme We would proceed on the assumption that the State had not framed any recruitment rules in terms of the proviso appended to Art.309 of the Constitution of India but the same by itself would not clothe the Commissioner of Revenue to make recruitments in violation of the provisions contained in Arts.14 and 16 of the Constitution of India The offers of appointment issued in favour of the respondents herein were cancelled inter alia on the premise that the same had been done without the knowledge of the Revenue Department of the State No records there for were available with the State As noticed hereinbefore,an inquiry had been made wherein the said Shri Tayeng,the then Commissioner of Revenue stated that no such appointment had been made to his knowledge The State proceeded on the said basis The offers of appointment were cancelled not on the ground that some irregularities had been committed in the process of recruitment but on the ground that they had been non-est in the eye of law The purported appointment letters were fake ones They were not issued by any authority competent therefor If the offers of appointments issued in favour of the respondents herein were forged documents,the State could not have been compelled to pay salaries to them from the State exchequer Any action,which had not been taken by an authority competent therefor and in complete violation of the constitutional and legal framework,would not be binding on the State In any event,having regard to the fact that the said authority himself had denied to have issued a letter,there was no reason for the State not to act pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof The action of the State did not,thus,lack bonafide Moreover,it was for the respondents who had filed the writ petitions to prove existence of legal right in their favour They had inter alia prayed for issuance of a writ of or in the nature of mandamus It was,thus,for them to establish existence of a legal right in their favour and a corresponding legal duty in the respondents to continue to be employed With a view to establish their legal rights to enable the High Court to issue a writ of mandamus,the respondents were obligated to establish that the appointments had been made upon following the constitutional mandate adumbrated in Arts.14 and 16 of the Constitution of India They have not been able to show that any advertisement had been issued inviting applications from eligible candidates to fill up the said posts It has also not been shown that the vacancies had been notified to the employment exchange The Commissioner furthermore was not the appointing authority He was only a cadre controlling authority He was merely put a Chairman of the DPC for non-ministerial post of the Revenue Department The term \"DPC\" would ordinarily mean the Departmental Promotion Committee The respondents had not been validly appointed and in that view of the matter,the question of their case being considered for promotion and/ or recruitment by the DPC did not and could not arise Even assuming that DPC would mean Selection Committee,there is noting on record to show who were its members and how and at whose instance it was constituted The Commissioner,as noticed hereinbefore,was the Chairman of the DPC.How the matter was referred to the DPC has not been disclosed Even the affidavit affirmed by Shri Tayeng before the High Court in this behalf is silent The appointing authority,in absence of any delegation of power having been made in that behalf,was the State Government The Government Order dated 12.01.1998 did not delegate the power of appointment to the Commissioner He,therefore,was wholly incompetent to issue the appointment letters The respondents,therefore,in our opinion,were not entitled to hold the posts In a case of this nature,where the facts are admitted,the principles of natural justice were not required to be complied with,particularly when the same would result in futility It is true that where appointments had been made by a competent authority or at least some steps have been taken in that behalf,the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with,in view of the decision of this Court in Murugayya Udayar 1991 Indlaw SC 904 (supra We,as noticed hereinbefore,do not know as to under what circumstances the orders of appointments were issued The said decision is not an authority for the proposition that the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with in all situations In Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi 1990 Indlaw SC 463 (supra),this Court was dealing with a question in regard to continuance of the Law Officers The question which arose herein was not raised It was held: \"34.In our opinion,the wide sweep of Art.14 undoubtedly takes within its fold the impugned circular issued by the State of U.P.in exercise of its executive power,irrespective of the precise nature of appointment of the Government Counsel in the districts and the other rights,contractual or statutory,which the appointees may have It is for this reason that we base our decision on the ground that independent of any statutory right,available to the appointees,and assuming for the purpose of this case that the rights flow only from the contract of appointment,the impugned circular,issued in exercise of the executive power of the State,must satisfy Art.14 of the Constitution and if it is shown to be arbitrary,it must be struck down However,we have referred to certain provisions relating to initial appointment,termination or renewal of tenure to indicate that the action is controlled at least by settled guidelines,followed by the State of U.P.,for a long time This too is relevant for deciding the question of arbitrariness alleged in the present case 35.It is now too well settled that every State action,in order to survive,must not be susceptible to the vice of arbitrariness which is the crux of Art.14 of the Constitution and basic to the rule of law,the system which governs us Arbitrariness is the very negation of the rule of law Satisfaction of this basic test in every State action is sine qua non to its validity and in this respect,the State cannot claim comparison with a private individual even in the field of contract This distinction between the State and a private individual in the field of contract has to be borne in the mind We in the facts and circumstances of this case do not see any arbitrariness on the part of the State in its action directing cancellation of appointments We may,on the other hand,notice that Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi 1990 Indlaw SC 463 (supra) has been distinguished by this Court in State of U.P.and Others v U.P.State Law Officers Association and Others [(1994) 2 SCC 204  1994 Indlaw SC 1289] stating: \"The reliance placed by the respondents in this behalf on Shrilekha Vidyarthi v State of U.P.1990 Indlaw SC 463 is misplaced for the obvious reason that the decision relates to the appointment of the District Government Counsel and the Additional/Assistant District Government Counsel who are the law officers appointed by the State Government to conduct civil,criminal and revenue cases in any court other than the High Court Their appointments are made through open competition from among those who are eligible for appointment and strictly on the basis of merit as evidenced by the particulars of their practice,opinions of the District Magistrate and the District Judge and also after taking into consideration their character and conduct Their appointment is in the first instance for one year It is only after their satisfactory performance during that period that a deed of engagement is given to them,and even then the engagement is to be for a term not exceeding three years The renewal of their further term again depends upon the quality of work and conduct,capacity as a lawyer,professional conduct,public reputation in general,and character and integrity as certified by the District Magistrate and the District Judge For the said purpose,the District Magistrate and the District Judge are required to maintain a character roll and a record of the work done by the officer and the capacity displayed by him in discharge of the work His work is also subject to strict supervision The shortcomings in the work are required to be brought to the notice of the Legal Remembrancer It will thus be seen that the appointment of the two sets of officers,viz.,the Government Counsel in the High Court with whom we are concerned,and the District Government Counsel with whom the said decision was concerned,are made by dissimilar procedures The latter are not appointed as a part of the spoils system Having been selected on merit and for no other consideration,they are entitled to continue in their office for the period of the contract of their engagement and they can be removed only for valid reasons The people are interested in their continuance for the period of their contracts and in their non-substitution by those who may come in through the spoils system It is in these circumstances that this Court held that the wholesale termination of their services was arbitrary and violative of Art.14 of the Constitution The ratio of the said decision can hardly be applied to the appointments of the law officers in the High Court whose appointment itself was arbitrary and was made in disregard of Art.14 of the Constitution as pointed out above\"[Emphasis added In Parshotam Lal Dhingra 1957 Indlaw SC 103 supra),this Court held that whoever holds civil posts would be entitled to protection of their services in terms of Cl.(2) of Art.309 of the Constitution of India in the event any disciplinary action is taken against them stating: \"The underlying idea obviously is that a provision like this will ensure to them a certain amount of security of tenure Cl.(2) protects government servants against being dismissed or removed or reduced in rank without being given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to them It will be noted that in cl.(1) the words dismissed and removed have been used while in cl.(2 the words dismissed removed and reduced in rank have been used The two protections are (1) against being dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which the appointment had been made,and (2) against being dismissed,removed or reduced in rank without being heard What,then,is the meaning of those expressions dismissed removed or reduced in rank It has been said in Jayanti Prasad v State of Uttar Pradesh 1951 Indlaw ALL 27 that these are technical words used in cases in which a persons services are terminated by way of punishment Those expressions,it is urged,have been taken from the service rules,where they were used to denote the three major punishments and it is submitted that those expressions should be read and understood in the same sense and treated as words of Art In Dhirender Singh and Others v State of Haryana and Others [(1997) 2 SCC 712  1996 Indlaw SC 1725],termination of an order of promotion in favour of the appellant was not interfered with by this Court as the same had not been approved by the DIG,being the competent authority In M.C.Mehta v Union of India and Others [(1999) 6 SCC 237  1999 Indlaw SC 1396],this Court developed the \"useless formality\" theory stating: \"More recently Lord Bingham has deprecated the useless formality theory in R.v Chief Constable of the Thames Valley Police Forces,ex p Cotton by giving six reasons.(See also his article Should Public Law Remedies be Discretionary 1991 PL,64 A detailed and emphatic criticism of the useless formality theory has been made much earlier in Natural Justice,Substance or Shadow by Prof.D.H.Clark of Canada (1975 PL,27 63) contending that Malloch and Glynn were wrongly decided Foulkes,Craig  and others say that the court cannot prejudge what is to be decided by the decision-making authority.de Smith says courts have not yet committed themselves to any one view though discretion is always with the court Wade says that while futile writs may not be issued,a distinction has to be made according to the nature of the decision Thus,in relation to cases other than those relating to admitted or indisputable facts,there is a considerable divergence of opinion whether the applicant can be compelled to prove that the outcome will be in his favour or he has to prove a case of substance or if he can prove a real likelihood of success or if he is entitled to relief even if there is some remote chance of success We may,however,point out that even in cases where the facts are not all admitted or beyond dispute,there is a considerable unanimity that the courts can,in exercise of their discretion,refuse certiorari,prohibition,mandamus or injunction even though natural justice is not followed We may also state that there is yet another line of cases as in State Bank of Patiala v S.K.Sharma,Rajendra Singh v State of M.P.1994 Indlaw MP 48 that even in relation to statutory provisions requiring notice,a distinction is to be made between cases where the provision is intended for individual benefit and where a provision is intended to protect public interest In the former case,it can be waived while in the case of the latter,it cannot be waived In Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan 2002 Indlaw SC 287 (supra),it was held: \"It is clear that if after the termination of services of the said Dr K.C.Rakesh,the orders of appointment are issued,such orders are not valid If such appointment orders are a nullity,the question of observance of principles of natural justice would not arise In Bar Council of India v High Court of Kerala [(2004) 6 SCC 311  2004 Indlaw SC 340],it was stated: \"Principles of natural justice,however,cannot be stretched too far Their application may be subject to the provisions of a statute or statutory rule In R.S.Garg v State of U.P.and Others [(2006) 6 SCC 430  2006 Indlaw SC 801],it was stated: \"A discretionary power as is well known cannot be exercised in an arbitrary manner It is necessary to emphasize that the State did not proceed on the basis that the amendment to the Rules was not necessary The action of a statutory authority,as is well known,must be judged on the basis of the norms set up by it and on the basis of the reasons assigned therefor The same cannot be supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise For the reasons aforementioned,the impugned judgments cannot be sustained They are set aside accordingly The appeals are allowed No costs Appeal allowed",

18.6.1994,he executed a Will in favour of the respondent Dr Karanth expired on 9.12.1997.Yakshagana Ballet dance as developed by Dr Karanth was performed in New Delhi on or about 18.9.2001.Respondent filed a suit for declaration,injunction and damages alleging violation of the copyright in respect of the said dance vested in her in terms of the said Will stating that Dr Karanth developed a new distinctive dance,drama troop or theatrical system which was named by him as 'Yaksha Ranga' which in his own words mean \"creative extension of traditional Yakshagana\" and,thus,the appellants infringed the copyright thereof by performing the same at New Delhi without obtaining her prior permission It was stated that Dr Karanth had composed seven verses or prasangas for staging Yaksharanga Ballet apart from bringing in changes in the traditional form thereof on its relevant aspects,namely,Raga,Tala,Scenic arrangement,Costumes etc These prasangas are: (i) Bhishma Vijaya; (ii) Nala

have been living in a specially built house \"Manasa\" of Smt Malini Mallya,who has built it with borrowed money at her cost She had joined my service as Copyist and later,she secured an employment in Life Insurance Corporation of India Ever since 1974 till now in my old age she has been serving me with exemplary devotion and sincerity And in this occasion I must also acknowledge with gratitude that she diligently cared and nursed my wife Leela Karanth during her prolonged illness till her last day And she has cared and looked after me also during my illness which at times had been quite serious,enfeebling me for long period In recognition of her devotion and sincere affection towards me in 1986 I have dedicated one of my novels namely,\"Antida Aparanji\" to her I have also placed on record her invaluable services to me in my Memoirs,\"Hunchu Mansina Hathu Mukhagalu\" 1991 Edition In my opinion,very long enduring and a signal service she has done to me and to my literary works is,in writing a bibliography of all my books-a highly meritorious and scholarly work involving so much of pains taking research,that it has been acclaimed and rated as the first of its kind in Kannada and highly appreciated by Critics and Scholars Apart from this,she has collected and edited all my stray writings from 1924 onwards up to date in eight Sumptuous volumes which are being published by Mangalore University This work also has brought her deserving fame and appreciation of Scholars Such painstaking service in this direction has brought to light several of my hitherto untraced,forgotten and unknown writings and thereby giving them extended or renewed lease of life For all these services,I hereby declare that after my death copyrights in respect of all my literary works shall vest with Smt Malini Mallya and she alone shall be entitled to receive royalties of all my books and she shall be entitled to print,publish and republish and market the same Whatever she may earn thereby shall be her exclusive income and property No one else shall have any right or claims for the same.12.From time to time I have distributed among my children all gold and silver jewels and ornaments and other valuables,which were gifted to me by my friends and admirers And I have distributed all copper and bronze vessels and utensils among my children while leaving my former home

mentioned above,that is,residuary after my death shall belong to Smt Malini Mallya alone Plaintiff-Respondent,inter alia,prayed for passing a judgment and decree against the defendants -appellants granting the following reliefs: \"1.A declaration that the plaintiff is the exclusive copyright holder in respect of Yaksharanga ballets,namely,Bhishma Vijaya,Kanakangi,Nala Damayanthi,Panchavati,Gaya Charitha,Chitrangadha,Abhimanyu Vadha,and for consequential permanent injunction restraining the Defendants,their agents,employees etc.from staging or performing any of the above said 7 ballets or

future interest on Rs.15,000/-at 15% p.a.till payment of the entire amount Appellants in their written statement,however,denied and disputed any copyright of the said dance in Dr Karanth alleging that whatever work he had done was in the capacity of a Director of the Kendra with the assistance,finance and staff provided by the Organization of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial College Trust in respect whereof a Committee was formed under him by the Board of Trustees It was furthermore contended that Dr Karanth was appointed as the President of the Executive Committee of Yakshagana Kendra for a period of three years by the appellant and while holding the said post only he expired By reason of a judgment and decree dated 14.11.2003,the District Judge,Udupi decreed the said suit declaring the plaintiff -respondent as a person having the exclusive copyright in respect of seven Prasangas and that she had acquired the same by reason of a Will as a residuary legatee and the defendants -appellants or their employees or agents were restrained from performing the said seven ballets or Prasangas or any parts thereof in any manner as evolved distinctively by Dr Karanth Appellants aggrieved thereby and dissatisfied therewith preferred an appeal before the Karnataka High Court which was marked as R.F.A.No.271 of 2004 By reason of the impugned judgment and order dated 5.12.2007,the said appeal has been dismissed Appellants are,thus,before us Rajiv Dhavan,learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of appellants in his usual fairness conceded i The copyright in the literary work has been assigned by reason of the said Will in favour of the respondent in terms of clause 12 of the Will ii) Dr Karanth has made substantial changes in the original traditional form of the Yakshagana dance Additions made in the form of the said dance including the Prasangas fell within the purview of 'originality' in respect whereof copyright could be claimed It was,however,urged i) Keeping in view of the findings of the learned trial judge,it ought to have been held that no cause of action arose against the appellants in this case as the Institution had performed the said dance at New Delhi in the memory of Dr Karanth without charging any fees ii The form of copyright as regards dramatic work as has been held by the High Court stating the same to be a part of the literary work is not correct as they connote two different things iii The form of injunction granted in favour of the plaintiff -respondent is not in terms of the provisions of the Copyright Act,1957 as the appellant as an institution or otherwise is entitled to use the same in terms of clauses (a),(i) and (l) of sub-Section (1) of Section 52 thereof Mr G.V.Chandrashekhar,learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent,on the other hand,would support the impugned judgment The Copyright Act,1957 (for short,\"the Act\") was enacted to amend and consolidate the law relating to copyright Section 2 is the interpretation section Section 2(c) defines 'artistic work' to mean (i) a painting,a sculpture,a drawing (including a diagram,map,chart or plan),an engraving or a photograph,whether or not any such

person taking the photograph; (v) in relation to a cinematograph film or sound recording,the producer; and (vi) in relation to any literary,dramatic,musical or artistic work which is computer-generated,the person who causes the work to be created The term \"communication to the public\" as defined in Section 2(ff) reads as under: \"(ff) \"communication to the public\" means making any work available for being seen or heard or otherwise enjoyed by the public directly or by any means of display or diffusion other than by issuing copies of such work regardless of whether any member of the pubic actually sees,hears or otherwise enjoys the work so made available Explanation For the purposes of this clause,communication through satellite or cable or any other means of simultaneous communication to more than one household or place of residence including residential rooms of any hotel or hostel shall be deemed to be communication to the public\" Section 2 (ffa) defines the word \"composer\",in relation to a musical work,to mean the person who composes the music regardless of whether he records it in any form of graphical notation Section 2(h) defines \"dramatic work\" to include any piece of recitation,choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show,the scenic arrangement or acting,form of which is fixed in writing or otherwise but does not

work shall be the owner of the copyright therein Proviso (d) appended thereto states that in the case of a Government work,Government shall,in the absence of any agreement to the contrary,be the first owner of the copyright therein Sections 22,23 and 52(1)(a),(i) and (l) of the Act,which are relevant for our purpose read as under 22 Term of copyright in published literary,dramatic,musical and artistic works Except as otherwise hereinafter provided,copyright shall subsist in any literary,dramatic,musical or artistic work (other than a photograph) published within the life time of the author until fifty years from the beginning of the calendar year following the year in which the author dies Explanation-In this section,the reference to the author shall in the case of a work of joint authorship,be construed as a reference to the author who dies last 23 -Term of copyright in anonymous and pseudonymous works.-(1 In the case of a literary,dramatic,musical or artistic work (other than

an author shall be deemed to have been disclosed,if either the identity of the author is disclosed publicly by both the author and the publisher or is otherwise established to the satisfaction of the Copyright Board by that author Certain acts not to be infringement of copyright.-(1 The following acts shall not constitute an infringement of copyright,namely:- (a) a fair dealing with a literary,dramatic,musical or artistic work not being a computer programme for the purpose of-(i Private use including research; (ii) criticism or review,whether of that work or of any other work; xxx xxx xxx (i) the performance,in the course of the Activities of an educational institution,of a literary,dramatic or musical work by the staff and student of the institution,or of a cinematograph film or a sound recording,if the audience is limited to such staff and students,the parents and guardians of the students and persons directly connected with the Activities of the institution or the communication to such an audience of a cinematograph film or sound recording l the performance of a literary,dramatic or musical work by an amateur club or society,if the performance is given to a non-paying audience,or for the benefit of a religious institution Before adverting to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties,we may notice the issues framed in the suit,which are: \"(i) Does plaintiff prove that late Dr Shivaramaji Karanth had acquired copyright in respect of seven Yakshagana Prasangas and also in respect of Yakshagana dramatic or theatrical form i.e.,Bhishma Vijaya,Nala Damayanthi,Kanakaangti or Kanakangi Kalyana,Abhimanyu or Abhimanyu Vadha,Chitrangadha or Babruvahana Kalaga,Panchavati Chritha followed in the plaint Has the plaintiff became entitled to the said right under the Registered Will dated 18.06.1994 Does the plaintiff prove that her right under the said Will was infringed by the defendants Indisputably,in view of the submissions made at the bar,respondent had acquired copyright in respect of seven Yakshagana Prasangas as also in respect of Yakshagana dramatic or theatrical form as a residuary legatee in terms of clause 12 of the Will dated 18.6.1994 However,we may notice that whereas the trial court has proceeded on the basis that clause 12 of the Will shall apply in the instant case,the High Court opined that clause 11 thereof is attracted,stating: \"No doubt,by reading para-12 of the 'Will' in isolation,one can certainly arrive at the conclusion that the bequest made in favour of the plaintiff is in the nature of residuary bequest But,that is not all,in the 'Will'-Ex P-1.I have already referred to para No.11 of the 'Will' while dealing with the topic dramatic works vis-'-vis literary work and therefore if the 'Will' is read in its entirety and if we take into account,the benefits that flow from the bequest made by Dr Karanth in favour of the plaintiff,it is not as if the plaintiff received the bequest only in respect of the things which form the residuary as mentioned in para-12 of the 'Will' but the plaintiff also was given the copyrights in respect of literary works and all books as well as the right to print,republished and mark the literary works as well as the books Referring to the new Encyclopaedia Britannica and Halsbury's Laws of England,that a literary work with dramatic elements in it would also be literary work,the High Court observed: \"Dramatic works also could contain in its,passages of great literary taste,as in the case of great plays of William Shakespear Therefore,the main classification as literary work and dramatic work cannot be construed to mean that dramatic work has nothing to do with literary work The only difference I see in them is that the dramatic work (Plays) forms the text upon which the performance of the plays rests whereas a 'literary work' enables one to read the printed words Neither of the two can be produced without the imaginative skill of the author It was furthermore held: \"I am of the considered opinion that all the above changes brought about by Dr Karanth in respect of Yakshagana Ballet leads to the inference that the imaginative faculties of Dr Karanth permeated the entire Yakshagana Prasangas and thus a new look was given to the Yakshagana Ballets I,therefore,hold that the bequest of copyright in literary works and books in favour of the plaintiff by Dr Karanth,will have to be treated as the bequest covering the dramatic works also since I have also drawn the conclusion that the dramatic works is also a form of literature Therefore,necessity of mentioning copyright separately in respect of dramatic works does not arise The plaintiff,therefore,is entitled to copyright even in respect of the dramatic works namely the seven prasangas,by virtue of bequest made in her favour in respect of copyrights and books Broadly speaking,a dramatic work may also come within the purview of literary work being a part of dramatic literature The new Encyclopaedia Britannica (Vol-IV) 15th Edition,provides the following information about \"Dramatic Literature Dramatic Literature: the texts of plays that can be read,as distinct from being seen and heard in performance We must,however,notice that the provisions the Act make a distinction between the 'literary work' and 'dramatic work'.Keeping in view the statutory provisions,there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that copyright in respect of performance of 'dance' would not come within the purview of the literary work but would come within the purview of the definition of 'dramatic work'.We,however,do not mean to suggest that any act of literary work will be outside the purview of the Will dated 18.6.1994.Our exercise in this behalf was only for the purpose of clarifying the provisions of the Act with reference to the findings arrived at by the High Court For the aforementioned reasons,we agree with Dr Dhavan that paragraph 12 of the Will,namely,residuary clause shall apply in the instant case apart from the areas which are otherwise covered by paragraph 11 of the Will The residuary clause will apply because it is well settled that no part of the stay lies in limbo It was also not a case where respondent in any manner whatsoever waived her right The learned trial judge on issue No.4 opined that plaintiff had not been able to prove actual loss or damage particularly having regard to the fact that Dr Karanth had associated himself with the appellants for a long time The learned trial judge recognized the equitable interest vested in the plaintiff -respondent A declaratory decree,therefore,was passed We may notice at this stage that the form of injunction granted both by the learned trial judge as also by the High Court in favour of the plaintiff-respondent The operative part of the judgment of the trial court reads as under: \"Defendants or their employees or agents are restrained from performing the above said 7 ballets or Prasangas or in parts thereof in any manner as evolved distinctively by Dr Karanth by way of permanent injunction The High Court,however,directed: \"(iii As far as the restraint order passed by the Trial Court by granting permanent injunction to the plaintiff is concerned,the same is modified by ordering that if the appellants desire to stage any of the seven Yakshagana prasangas in the manner and form as conceived in all respects viz.,costumes,choreography and direction by Dr Karanth,the appellants can do so only in accordance with the provisions of the Copyrights Act,1957 in view of copyright in seven prasangas vesting with the plaintiff Decree for injunction is an equitable relief The courts while passing a decree for permanent injunction would avoid multiplicity of proceedings The court while passing such a decree,is obligated to consider the statutory provisions governing the same For the said purpose,it must be noticed as to what is a copyright and in respect of the matters the same cannot be claimed or otherwise the same is lodged by conditions and subject to statutory limitation In R.G.Anand vs M/s Delux Films & ors.[(1978 4 SCC 118]1978 Indlaw SC 294,this Court held: \"Thus,on a careful consideration and elucidation of the various authorities and the case law on the subject discussed above,the following propositions emerge: 1.There can be no copyright in an idea,subject-matter,themes,plots or historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form,manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the author of the copyrighted work 2.Where the same idea is being developed in a different manner,it is manifest that the source being common,similarities are bound to occur In such a case the courts should determine whether or not the similarities are on fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work If the defendant's work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted work with some variations here and there it would amount to violation of the copyright In other words,in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy 3.One of the surest and the safest test to determine whether or not there has been a violation of copyright is to see if the reader,spectator or the viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original 4.Where the theme is the same but is presented and treated differently so that the subsequent work becomes a completely new work,no question of violation of copyright arises 5.Where however apart from the similarities appearing in the two works there are also material and broad dissimilarities which negative the intention to copy the original and the coincidences appearing in the two works are clearly incidental no infringement of the copyright comes into existence 6.As a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved by clear and cogent evidence after applying the various tests laid down by the case-law discussed above 7.Where however the question is of the violation of the copyright of stage play by a film producer or a director the task of the plaintiff becomes more difficult to prove piracy It is manifest that unlike a stage play a film has a much broader prospective,wider field and a bigger background where the defendants can by introducing a variety of incidents give a colour and complexion different from the manner in which the copyrighted work has expressed the idea Even so,if the viewer after seeing the film gets a totality of impression that the film is by and large a copy of the original play,violation of the copyright may be said to be proved Yet again in Eastern Book Company & ors vs D.B.Modak & Anr.[(2008 1 SCC 1]2007 Indlaw SC 1341,this Court held: \"The Copyright Act is not concerned with the original idea but with the expression of thought Copyright has nothing to do with originality or literary merit Copyrighted material is that what is created by the author by his own skill,labour and investment of capital,maybe it is a derivative work which gives a flavour of creativity The copyright work which comes into being should be original in the sense that by virtue of selection,coordination or arrangement of pre-existing data contained in the work,a work somewhat different in character is produced by the author On the face of the provisions of the Copyright Act,1957,we think that the principle laid down by the Canadian Court would be applicable in copyright of the judgments of the Apex Court We make it clear that the decision of ours would be confined to the judgments of the courts which are in the public domain as by virtue of Section 52 of the Act there is no copyright in the original text of the judgments To claim copyright in a compilation,the author must produce the material with exercise of his skill and judgment which may not be creativity in the sense that it is novel or non-obvious,but at the same time it is not a product of merely labour and capital The derivative work produced by the author must have some distinguishable features and flavour to raw text of the judgments delivered by the court The trivial variation or inputs put in the judgment would not satisfy the test of copyright of an author The High Court,in our opinion,should have clarified that the appellants can also take the statutory benefit of the provisions contained in clauses (a),(i) and (l) of sub-section (1) of Section 52 of the Act Section 52 of the Act provides for certain acts which would not constitute an infringement of copyright When a fair dealing is made,inter alia,of a literary or dramatic work for the purpose of private use including research and criticism or review,whether of that work or of any other work,the right in terms of the provisions of the said Act cannot be claimed Thus,if some performance or dance is carried out within the purview of the said clause,the order of injunction shall not be applicable Similarly,appellant being an educational institution,if the dance is performed within the meaning of provisions of clause (i) of sub-section (1) of Section 52 of the Act strictly,the order of injunction shall not apply thereto also Yet again,if such performance is conducted before a non-paying audience by the appellant,which is an institution if it comes within the purview of amateur club or society,the same would not constitute any violation of the said order of injunction With the aforementioned modification in the order of injunction,this appeal is dismissed However,in the facts and circumstances of the case,there shall be no order as to costs Appeal dismissed",

    "data": "Accused Pathan Hussain Basha,was married to Pathan Haseena Begum (now deceased) on 23rd June,2002 at Guntur It was an arranged marriage At the time of marriage,it was promised that a dowry of Rs.25,000/-,besides other formalities,would be paid by the side of the wife to the husband Out of this amount,a sum of Rs.15,000/was paid at that time and it was promised that the balance dowry of Rs.10,000/would be paid in the month of October,2002,upon which the marriage was performed The father of the bride could not pay the balance amount within time,because he lacked the resources The accused Pathan Hussain Basha,his father Pathan Khadar Basha,and mother Pathan Nazeer Abi forced her to get the balance amount of dowry Despite such pressure,she was not able to get that money from her family It is the case of the prosecution that for non-payment of dowry,the accused persons harassed the deceased and subjected her to cruelty They even refused to send her to her parental house This was informed by the deceased to various persons,including her relatives and elders She was unable to bear the cruelty to which she was subjected,by the accused persons On 15th February,2003,at about 11 a.m.,the deceased committed suicide by hanging herself in the house of the accused When Pathan Basheerunnisa,LW3 returned from her work,the accused sent her out giving her money to bring the soaps upon which she went out and when she came back,she found the accused absent and the bride hanging in the house Subsequently,LW-3 Pathan Basheerunnisa sent her grandson Pathan Inayatullah Khan,LW-4 to the house of the parents of the deceased to inform them about the incident When the parents of the deceased came to the house of the accused and found the deceased hanging from the beam with a saree,they untied her and took her to the Government General Hospital,Guntur hoping that the deceased may be alive However,upon medical examination by the doctor,she was declared brought dead The father of the deceased Pathan Yasin Khan,LW-1 and her mother Pathan Shamshad Begum,LW-2 were present at that time LW-1,lodged the report,which was registered by Sri K.Srinivasarao,LW-16,the Sub-Inspector of Police The FIR was registered under Section 304B and Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code,1860 (for short the \"IPC\").Thereafter,investigation was conducted by one Shri P.Devadass,LW-17.He inspected the site from where he recovered and seized the saree that had been used for hanging This was done in the presence of LW-10 and LW-11,Shaik Ibrahim and Mohd Ghouse,respectively Thereupon,the body was sent for postmortem examination through Constable P.Venkateswara Reddy,LW-15.LW-17,P.Devdass,also took photographs of the scene.3 LW-13,Dr M.Madhusudana Reddy conducted autopsy over the body of the deceased and prepared post-mortem certificate giving the cause of death as asphyxia,as a result of hanging On 16th February,2003,at about 5 p.m.,Investigating Officer arrested all the three accused persons They faced the trial and were convicted by learned Sixth Additional Munsif Magistrate,Guntur for committing an offence under Sections

Andhra Pradesh,vide its judgment dated 26th October,2006,while allowing the appeal in part,convicted accused Nos.1 and 2 for the aforementioned offences,however,acquitted accused No.3,namely,Pathan Khadar Basha The sentence awarded by the Trial Court was confirmed This gave rise to filing of the present appeals First and the foremost,we must consider what is the evidence led by the prosecution to bring home the guilt of accused Accused were charged with offences under Sections 498A and 304B of the IPC.The FIR in the present case was lodged by LW-1,who is the father of the deceased According to this witness,on 23rd January,2002,the marriage of his daughter was solemnised with accused Pathan Hussain Basha and he had accepted to give Rs.25,000/in marriage He had given only Rs.15,000/and had agreed to pay Rs.10,000/-,after four months This witness has further specifically stated that the said accused treated his daughter in a proper manner for about two months In the marriage,he had also given a gold chain,a double bed,an iron safe and other items He had called his son-in-law,accused No.1,to his house,as per custom,at that point the accused demanded a ceiling fan A ceiling fan was lying with the witness and he gave that to his son in law,however,he protested the same on the ground that the old fan is not acceptable to him and he would like to have a new fan,which was bought for Rs.650/by the witness and given to his son-in-law When he again invited his son-in-law and the mother-in-law of his daughter,even then he had gifted some presents to them The accused asked for Rs.1,000/with a ring for the deceased The witness could pay only Rs.500/upon which the accused refused to take the deceased to the matrimonial home and went away Later on,the accused came to fetch deceased Subsequently,the motherin-law of the deceased,again,demanded the balance dowry amount of Rs.10,000/-,which he could not pay His daughter,after the Ramzan festival,had informed him that the accused persons were harassing her and were even beating and abusing her All three accused used to beat her for the remaining amount of dowry On 15th February,2003,a boy had come to him and told him that his daughter had died by hanging herself,whereupon he went to the house of the accused and found that his daughter was hanged to a wooden beam with a saree and she was dead The saree was removed,she was taken to the hospital where she was reported to have 'brought dead'.The statement of this witness i.e.LW-1 is corroborated by LW-3 and LW-7 It is stated by LW-3 that she knew all the accused persons as she was residing in the house of the accused and the deceased According to this witness also,in the beginning they were happy,however after some time,she used to hear some quarrel between the deceased and the accused persons Accused No.2,Pathan Nazeer Abi had given her some amount and asked her to go and bring the soaps After bringing the soaps,she went to the house of the accused persons and found that the accused was absent and the deceased was hanging on one side of the room After seeing this,she raised cries and people came to the scene LW-4,Pathan Inayatullah Khan,the grandson of LW-3,went to the house of the parents of the deceased and informed them about the unfortunate incident LW-7 stated on oath that he was present at the time of giving of dowry to the accused by the family of the deceased He confirmed the fact that Rs.15,000/was given at the time of marriage and Rs.10,000/was to be given within some time,which the father of the deceased failed to provide According to him,the accused persons used to harass the deceased primarily for non-payment of the amount of dowry,as a result of which,she was forced to commit suicide In fact,there is no dispute to the fact that the deceased died of hanging Dr M.Madhusudana Reddy,LW-13 who was the Associate Professor in Forensic Medicine at Guntur Medical College,performed the post-mortem over the body of the deceased In the medical report,LW13,he noticed \"Oblique ligature mark of 17 x 2.5 cm present over front and left sides of neck\" as well as noticed \"Abrasion 1.5 x 1 cm present over lower part of middle of chin Injuries were found to be antemortem in nature,and the cause of death was stated to be asphyxia,as a result of hanging LW-14 is a witness to the seizure of the body and she noticed injuries on the body of the deceased From the above evidence,it is clear that the dowry demands were being raised by the accused persons persistently from the family of the deceased and for that they even harassed the deceased,by beating and abusing her She had informed her parents of the ill-treatment and the cruelty inflicted on her for non-giving of dowry The period intervening between the marriage and the death of the deceased is very small They were married in the year 2002 and she committed suicide by hanging on 15th February,2003.The witnesses,including LW-1 have stated that for the first few months they were happy,but thereafter,there were quarrels between the accused and the deceased Accused Pathan Hussain Basha,when he had gone to the parental house of the deceased,demanded different items like fan,ring and Rs.1,000/in cash,and the balance of the agreed dowry amount Since,these demands were not satisfied instantaneously,he even left the deceased at her parental house At this stage,it will be appropriate for us to examine as to what are the ingredients of an offence punishable under Section 304B of the IPC In the case of Biswajit Halder alias Babu Halder and Others v State of W.B.[(2008) 1 SCC 202 2007 Indlaw SC 304],the Court stated the ingredients of this provision as follows: \"10.The basic ingredients to attract the provisions of Section 304-B are as follows 1) the death of a woman should be caused by burns or fatal injury or otherwise than under normal circumstances; (2) such death should have occurred within seven years of her marriage; (3) she must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband; and (4) such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with demand for dowry 11.Alongside insertion of Section 304-B in IPC,the legislature also introduced Section 113-B of the Evidence Act,which lays down when the question as to whether a person has committed the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment for,or in connection with,any demand for dowry,the court shall presume that such person had caused the dowry death 12.Explanation appended to Section 113-B lays down that: \"For the purpose of this section,'dowry death' shall have the same meaning as in Section 304-B of Indian Penal Code 13.If Section 304-B IPC is read together with Section 113-B of the Evidence Act,a comprehensive picture emerges that if a married woman dies in unnatural circumstances at her matrimonial home within 7 years from her marriage and there are allegations of cruelty or harassment upon such married woman for or in connection with demand of dowry by the husband or relatives of the husband,the case would squarely come under \"dowry death\" and there shall be a presumption against the husband and the relatives Besides examining the ingredients of the provision,it would also be necessary for us to examine the meaning and connotation of the expressions 'dowry death','soon before her death' and 'in connection with,any demand for dowry' as appearing in the said section Amongst others,lapse of time between the date of marriage and the date of death is also a relevant consideration for the Court while examining whether the essential ingredients of the provision are satisfied or not in a given case In the case of Ashok Kumar v State of Haryana [(2010) 12 SCC 350 2010 Indlaw SC 502],this Court explained these terms in some elucidation and the effect of the deeming fiction appearing in the section,as follows: \"11.The appellant was charged with an offence under Section 304-B of the Code This penal section clearly spells out the basic ingredients as well as the matters which are required to be construed strictly and with significance to the cases where death is caused by burns,bodily injury or the death occurring otherwise than under normal circumstances,in any manner,within seven years of a marriage It is the first criteria which the prosecution must prove Secondly,that \"soon before her death\" she had been subjected to cruelty or harassment by the husband or any of the relatives of the husband for,or in connection with,any demand for dowry then such a death shall be called \"dowry death\" and the husband or the relative,as the case may be,will be deemed to have caused such a death The Explanation to this section requires that the expression \"dowry\" shall have the same meaning as in S.2 of the Act 12.The definition of \"dowry\" under S.2 of the Act reads as under: \"2.Definition of dowry In this Act,'dowry' means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly- (a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or (b) by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person,to either party to the marriage or to any other person,at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties,but does not include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) applies Explanation II.-The expression 'valuable security' has the same meaning as in S.30 of the Penal Code (45 of 1860 From the above definition it is clear that,\"dowry\" means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly by one party to another,by parents of either party to each other or any other person at,before,or at any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties but does not include dower or mahr under the Muslim Personal Law All the expressions used under this section are of a very wide magnitude The expressions \"or any time after marriage\" and \"in connection with the marriage of the said parties\" were introduced by the amending Act 63 of 1984 and Act 43 of 1986 with effect from 2-101985 and 19-11-1986 respectively These amendments appear to have been made with the intention to cover all demands at the time,before and even after the marriage so far they were in connection with the marriage of the said parties This clearly shows the intent of the legislature that these expressions are of wide meaning and scope The expression \"in connection with the marriage\" cannot be given a restricted or a narrower meaning The expression \"in connection with the marriage\" even in common parlance and on its plain language has to be understood generally The object being that everything,which is offending at any time i.e.at,before or after the marriage,would be covered under this definition,but the demand of dowry has to be \"in connection with the marriage\" and not so customary that it would not attract,on the face of it,the provisions of this section At this stage,it will be appropriate to refer to certain examples showing what has and has not been treated by the courts as \"dowry\".This Court,in Ran Singh v State of Haryana,(2008) 4 SCC 700 2008 Indlaw SC 120 held that the payments which are customary payments,for example,given at the time of birth of a child or other ceremonies as are prevalent in the society or families to the marriage,would not be covered under the expression \"dowry Again,in Satvir Singh v State of Punjab,(2001)8 SCC 633 2001 Indlaw SC 224 this Court held that the word \"dowry\" should be any property or valuable given or agreed to be given in connection with the marriage The customary payments in connection with birth of a child or other ceremonies are not covered within the ambit of the word \"dowry This Court,in Madhu Sudan Malhotra v Kishore Chand Bhandari,1988 Supp SCC 424 1987 Indlaw SC 28308 held that furnishing of a list of ornaments and other household articles such as refrigerator,furniture and electrical appliances,etc.to the parents or guardians of the bride,at the time of settlement of the marriage,prima facie amounts to demand of dowry within the meaning of S.2 of the Act The definition of \"dowry\" is not restricted to agreement or demand for payment of dowry before and at the time of marriage but even include subsequent demands,was the dictum of this Court in State of A.P.v Raj Gopal Asawa,(2004)4 SCC 470 2004 Indlaw SC 205 The courts have also taken the view that where the husband had demanded a specific sum from his father-in-law and upon not being given,harassed and tortured the wife and after some days she died,such cases would clearly fall within the definition of \"dowry\" under the Act S.4 of the Act is the penal section and demanding a \"dowry\",as defined under S.2 of the Act,is punishable under this section As already noticed,we need not deliberate on this aspect,as the accused before us has neither been charged nor punished for that offence We have examined the provisions of S.2 of the Act in a very limited sphere to deal with the contentions raised in regard to the applicability of the provisions of Section 304-B of the Code We have already referred to the provisions of Section 304-B of the Code and the most significant expression used in the section is \"soon before her death\".In our view,the expression \"soon before her death\" cannot be given a restricted or a narrower meaning They must be understood in their plain language and with reference to their meaning in common parlance These are the provisions relating to human behaviour and,therefore,cannot be given such a narrower meaning,which would defeat the very purpose of the provisions of the Act Of course,these are penal provisions and must receive strict construction But,even the rule of strict construction requires that the provisions have to be read in conjunction with other relevant provisions and scheme of the Act Further,the interpretation given should be one which would avoid absurd results on the one hand and would further the object and cause of the law so enacted on the other We are of the considered view that the concept of reasonable time is the best criteria to be applied for appreciation and examination of such cases This Court in Tarsem Singh v State of Punjab,(2008 16 SCC 155 2008 Indlaw SC 1962 held that the legislative object in providing such a radius of time by employing the words \"soon before her death\" is to emphasise the idea that her death should,in all probabilities,has been the aftermath of such cruelty or harassment In other words,there should be a reasonable,if not direct,nexus between her death and the dowryrelated cruelty or harassment inflicted on her Similar view was expressed by this Court in Yashoda v State of M.P,(2004)3 SCC 98 2004 Indlaw SC 132 where this Court stated that determination of the period would depend on the facts and circumstances of a given case However,the expression would normally imply that there has to be reasonable time gap between t he cruelty inflicted and the death in question If this is so,the legislature in its wisdom would have specified any period which would attract the provisions of this section However,there must be existence of proximate link between the acts of cruelty along with the demand of dowry and the death of the victim For want of any specific period,the concept of reasonable period would be applicable Thus,the cruelty,harassment and demand of dowry should not be so ancient,whereafter,the couple and the family members have lived happily and that it would result in abuse of the said protection Such demand or harassment may not strictly and squarely fall within the scope of these provisions unless definite evidence was led to show to the contrary These matters,of course,will have to be examined on the facts and circumstances of a given case The cruelty and harassment by the husband or any relative could be directly relatable to or in connection with,any demand for dowry The expression \"demand for dowry\" will have to be construed ejusdem generis to the word immediately preceding this expression Similarly,\"in connection with the marriage\" is an expression which has to be given a wider connotation It is of some significance that these expressions should be given appropriate meaning to avoid undue harassment or advantage to either of the parties These are penal provisions but ultimately these are the social legislations,intended to control offences relating to the society as a whole Dowry is something which existed in our country for a considerable time and the legislature in its wisdom considered it appropriate to enact the law relating to dowry prohibition so as to ensure that any party to the marriage is not harassed or treated with cruelty for satisfaction of demands in consideration and for subsistence of the marriage The Court cannot ignore one of the cardinal principles of criminal jurisprudence that a suspect in the Indian law is entitled to the protection of Art.20 of the Constitution of India as well as has a presumption of innocence in his favour In other words,the rule of law requires a person to be innocent till proved guilty The concept of deeming fiction is hardly applicable to the criminal jurisprudence In contradistinction to this aspect,the legislature has applied the concept of deeming fiction to the provisions of Section 304-B.Where other ingredients of Section 304-B are satisfied,in that event,the husband or all relatives shall be deemed to have caused her death In other words,the offence shall be deemed to have been committed by fiction of law Once the prosecution proves its case with regard to the basic ingredients of Section 304-B,the Court will presume by deemed fiction of law that the husband or the relatives complained of,has caused her death Such a presumption can be drawn by the Court keeping in view the evidence produced by the prosecution in support of the substantive charge under Section 304-B of the Code Applying these principles to the facts of the present case,it is clear that the ingredients of Section 304B read with Section 498A IPC are completely satisfied in the present case By a deeming fiction in law,the onus shifts on to the accused to prove as to how the deceased died It is for the accused to show that the death of the deceased did not result from any cruelty or demand of dowry by the accused persons The accused did not care to explain as to how the death of his wife occurred Denial cannot be treated to be the discharge of onus Onus has to be discharged by leading proper and cogent evidence It was expected of the accused to explain as to how and why his wife died,as well as his conduct immediately prior and subsequent to the death of the deceased Maintaining silence cannot be equated to discharge of onus by the accused In the present case,the prosecution by reliable and cogent evidence has established the guilt of the accused There being no rebuttal thereto,there is no occasion to interfere in the judgments of the courts under appeal The High Court acquitted Pathan Khadar Basha,the fatherin-law of the deceased,as there was no direct evidence against him His acquittal has not been challenged by the State before us,thus,we are not called upon to discuss this aspect of the matter Accused Pathan Hussain Basha and Pathan Nazeer Abi have rightly been found guilty of the offence by the courts While we see no reason to differ with the concurrent findings recorded by the trial court and the High Court,we do see some substance in the argument raised on behalf of the appellants that keeping in view the prosecution evidence,the attendant circumstances,the age of the accused and the fact that they have already being in jail for a considerable period,the Court may take lenient view as far as the quantum of sentence is concerned The offences having been proved against the accused and keeping in view the attendant circumstances,we are of the considered view that ends of justice would be met,if the punishment awarded to the appellants is reduced Consequently,we award ten years Rigorous Imprisonment to the appellants The appeals are partially accepted to the extent afore-indicated Appeals partly allowed",

    "data": "These three appeals by special leave are directed against the order dated September 9,2004 passed by Intellectual Property Appellate Board (for short,'IPAB') whereby it ordered the removal of appellant's mark 'Infosys' from the register of trade marks in respect of computer stationery,computer manuals,printed matter for computer,instructional and teaching materials,computer hardware and peripherals and machine and machine tools The appellant is Infosys Technologies Limited It was incorporated and registered under the Companies Act,1956 on July 2,1981 in the name of Infosys Consultants Private Limited The appellant got the trade mark 'Infosys' registered in 1987 in classes 16 and 9 in connection with computer stationery,computer manuals,printed manual for computer instruction and teaching materials; computer hardwares,computer interface,computer peripherals,electronics telex interface and in 1988 in class 7 in connection with machine and machine tools and motors (not for land vehicles).The particulars with reference to the trade mark registered by the appellant are as follows On April 21,1992,the name of the company Infosys Consultants Pvt Limited was changed to Infosys Technologies Pvt Ltd.and thereafter on June 2,1992,the name was changed to the present name,i.e Infosys Technologies Limited The first respondent is Jupiter Infosys Limited The first respondent was incorporated and registered in September 1978 under the name of Jupiter Agencies Pvt Limited The name of the first respondent was changed to Jupiter Infosys (P) Limited in August,1995 and now since July,2003,the name is changed to Jupiter International Limited On October 11,1996,the appellant instituted a suit in the Calcutta High Court for perpetual injunction,inter alia,restraining the first respondent from infringing the appellant's mark 'Infosys' by using the mark 'Infosys' by itself or in combination with other marks in course of its trade The appellant also prayed for an interim order in the suit On November 22,1996,the Calcutta High Court by an ad-interim order restrained the first respondent from using the word 'Infosys' in any manner in relation to the goods for the time being The ad-interim order was confirmed on November 29,1996 The appellant having come to know of several instances of misuse of mark 'Infosys' also filed a writ petition (being writ petition no.14214 of 2000) before the Calcutta High Court,inter alia,praying that the Registrar of Companies be restrained from registering the companies bearing the name 'Infosys'.On September 13,2000,the Calcutta High Court restrained the Department of Company Affairs and Registrar of Companies from incorporating any company bearing the name 'Infosys' without the permission of the appellant In January 2001,the appellant filed yet another suit before the High Court of Judicature at Madras for permanent injunction restraining the first respondent from offering shares to the public as claimed in the Initial Public Offer (IPO) using 'Infosys'.The Single Judge of the Madras High Court passed an interim restraint order on February 1,2001 against the first respondent The said order was confirmed on May 22,2001 to remain operative till disposal of suit The first respondent then filed three separate applications before the Madras High Court,inter alia,under Sections 46 and 56 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act,1958 the 1958 Act').In O.P.No.764 of 2001,the first respondent prayed for the removal/rectification of the entry in the register of trade mark in respect of trade mark No.475269 in Class 16 while in the other two applications being O.P.No.765 of 2001 and O.P.No.766 of 2001,the first respondent prayed for removal/rectification of trade mark No.475267 in Class 9 and trade mark No.484837 in Class 7 respectively The appellant opposed these applications on diverse grounds by filing counter affidavits On August 12,2003,the Madras High Court framed the following issues: a) Whether the mark applied for registration was used in respect of the goods for which the mark was registered b) Whether the respondent had a bonafide intention to use the mark applied for under section 18 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act c)Whether the mark registered in favour of the respondent is a service mark d)Whether there is a non use of registered trade mark by the respondent for a period of over 5 years and 1 month e)Whether the registered trade mark is disentitled for protection in a Court of Law under Section 11(e) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act f)Whether the registered trade mark has lost its distinctiveness and is liable to be removed under section 32(c g) Whether the respondent has committed fraud while obtaining registration of the mark And h)To what further relief The 1958 Act was repealed by the Trade Marks Act,1999 (for short,'the 1999 Act').In terms of Section 100 of the 1999 Act,the three petitions filed by the first respondent before the Madras High Court for rectification/removal of registered trade mark Nos.475269,475267 and 484837 were transferred to the IPAB Some more facts may be noticed The appellant filed yet another suit (being suit no.2115 of 2002) before Delhi High Court for infringement of trade mark and passing off against the first respondent In that suit,the appellant also made an application for grant of temporary injunction The vacation Judge of the Delhi High Court,on December 27,2002 passed an order of temporary injunction against the first respondent as follows: \"Notice for 24th March,2003 before the Joint Registrar Heard Perused the averments made in the suit and application which are duly supported by documents on record I am of the opinion that in case ex-parte ad-interim orders are not granted,the relief claimed itself may be rendered infructuous Accordingly it is directed that pending further consideration of the matter after notice for the next date of hearing,the defendants are restrained by themselves,their directors,employees,agents and/or others acting on its behalf,from using the trade mark/corporate name INFOSYS or any other mark/name deceptively similar trade mark or colourable imitation thereof as a mark and/or corporate name or as part of a mark and/or business name,in respect of goods and/or services,for publicity on propaganda,on websites and or in domain names,in any way,whatsoever,thereby causing infringement of the registered trade mark INFOSYS of the plaintiff in isolation or in combination with words/letters/numbers their advertisements as part of their corporate name either in isolation or in goods and services,or in or by way of any advertisement/publicity campaigns etc Compliance of Order XXXIX Rule 3 CPC within three days The said suit was transferred to the Court of the Additional District Judge,Tis Hazari Court,Delhi In that suit,an affidavit came to be filed by the first respondent wherein it was stated that the name of the company has been changed from Jupiter Infosys Limited to Jupiter International Limited and a certificate to that effect has been issued by the Registrar of Companies,Kolkata under the Companies Act,1956 and no dispute remains between the parties under the trade mark The relevant statement made in the affidavit dated July 14,2003 (we were informed that the date of the affidavit is July 14,2004) reads as follows: \" That in the meantime the defendant has already changed the Trade Mark namely \"Jupiter International Ltd.\" in place of \"Jupiter Infosys Ltd The copy of the incorporation on change of name which was issued by the registrar of the Companies are being marked and annexed herewith as Annexure A That now there is no dispute between the plaintiff and defendant under the Trade Mark Based on this affidavit,the suit was partially decreed in favour of the appellant on November 10,2004 In 2007,however,the first respondent filed a suit in the Court of Additional District Judge,Delhi for setting aside the decree dated November 10,2004.That suit is said to be pending The IPAB proceeded with the matter in light of the issues that were already framed by the High Court and heard the parties The IPAB in the impugned order while dealing with the plea of limitation raised by the appellant held that the first respondent was the appropriate aggrieved party in the matter in view of the fresh cause of action having arisen to the first respondent on filing of Civil Suit No.71 of 2001 by the appellant before the Madras High Court The IPAB in the impugned order held that the trade mark Nos.475269,475267 and 484837 have not been used by the appellant for more than a period of five years and one month and the appellant also failed to make out that it had been in manufacturing or trading of the goods for which it had taken Registration Nos.475269,475267 and 484837.Consequently,the IPAB allowed the applications made by the first respondent purportedly under Section 46(1)(b) of The 1958 Act and directed the Registrar to remove these registrations from the register We heard Mr Akhil Sibal,learned counsel for the appellant and Mr Vaibhav Gaggar,learned counsel for the first respondent at quite some length Mr Akhil Sibal,learned counsel for the appellant argued that an application for rectification,whether under Section 46 or Section 56 of The 1958 Act,can only be preferred by a 'person aggrieved'; the applicant must not only be a person aggrieved on the date of the application but must continue to remain a person aggrieved until such time as the rectification application is finally decided He contended that the first respondent is not shown to have ever traded or intended to trade in any goods covered by the appellant's registrations under Classes 7 and 16 and as such the first respondent is not a 'person aggrieved' with regard to the appellant's registrations under these two classes As regards Class 9 he would submit that in view of the affidavit filed by the first respondent on July 14,2004 in the Court of Additional District Judge,Delhi the first respondent ceases to be an aggrieved person on the date of consideration of the rectification application Learned counsel heavily relied upon two decisions of this Court: (1) Hardie Trading Ltd.& Anr.v Addisons Paint & Chemicals Ltd.(2003) 11 SCC 92) 2003 Indlaw SC 756 and (2) Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba v Tosiba Appliances Company & Ors.(2008) 10 SCC 766) 2008 Indlaw SC 1395 Assailing the finding of the IPAB as regards non-use by the appellant during the relevant period,learned counsel for the appellant argued that the said finding was erroneous on legal as well as factual premise He contended that the IPAB erred in holding that software was a 'service' and the subject registrations were in relation to goods without considering the wide definition of 'goods' provided under Section 2(g) of The 1958 Act Akhil Sibal argued that the IPAB committed grave error in relying upon the provisions of the 1999 Act and the Trade Marks Rules,2002 when these provisions were not applicable as the applications were filed under The 1958 Act According to him,the IPAB sought to rely upon 'computer programming' which is a 'service' enumerated in Class 42,without considering the distinction between a 'computer programme' and 'computer programming' and without noticing the entry 'computer' under Class 9 which falls within 'goods'.Learned counsel would submit that in examining the question of non-use under Section 46(1)(b),the IPAB failed to consider that the requisite use must be 'in relation to goods' under registration,which is extensively defined under Section 2(2)(b) of The 1958 Act Akhil Sibal,learned counsel also argued that the IPAB failed to have regard to the proviso to Section 46(1),in terms of which it is open to the registered proprietor to rely upon use of the registered trade mark during the relevant period in relation to 'goods of the same description',in order to resist an application for rectification He contended that the IPAB failed to apply proper legal tests for determining 'goods of the same description' and had that been done it would be evident that 'computer software' amounts to 'goods of the same description' as 'computer hardware'.In this regard,he relied upon M/s Eagle Potteries Private Ltd.v M/s Eagle Flask Industries Pvt Ltd.(AIR 1993 Bombay 185); 1992 Indlaw MUM 6327 Lever Brothers,Port Sunlight Ld.v Sunniwite Products Ld.(1949) 66 RPC 84 The Ritz Hotel v Charles of the Ritz  (1989 RPC 333) and Australian Wine Importers' Trade Mark 6 RPC 311 Learned counsel for the appellant also submitted that in any view of the matter,the IPAB erred in exercising its discretion under Section 46 of The 1958 Act without taking into consideration the aspect of public interest He argued that the IPAB ought to have considered whether use of mark 'Infosys' by the first respondent on computer hardware would create confusion in the mind of the consumers that they might be led to believe that the said hardware is manufactured by the appellant Learned counsel,thus,submitted that the impugned order is unsustainable and liable to be set aside On the other hand,an objection is raised in the written submissions on behalf of the first respondent and reference was made in support of the objection to seven Judge Bench decision of this Court in L.Chandrakumar v Union of India & Ors.(1997) 3 SCC 261) 1997 Indlaw SC 2816 that challenge to the order of IPAB directly in the appeal before this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution is barred In reply to the arguments of learned counsel for the appellant,Mr Vaibhav Gaggar,learned counsel for the first respondent strenuously urged that the plea of 'aggrieved person' is a new plea and raised substantially for the first time before this Court He argued that the appellant has not taken the plea of the first respondent not being a 'person aggrieved' with respect to filing of the applications for rectification before the IPAB; merely urging the plea that the first respondent has no locus standi in the written submissions before the IPAB is not sufficient Learned counsel would submit that the appellant has,for the first time,argued before this Court that the first respondent is not a person aggrieved and/or not capable of maintaining the rectification proceedings with respect to each and every good for which the appellant has been registered since the first respondent has not been registered for all the goods Vaibhav Gaggar rather asserted that the first respondent is a person aggrieved in view of the fact that various suits for infringement have been filed by the appellant against the first respondent and on the date of the applications for rectification/removal of the subject registrations from the register,the suits were pending With reference to the affidavit dated July 14,2004 filed by the first respondent before the Court of Additional District Judge,he submitted that the said affidavit has no relevance in consideration as to whether the first respondent is an aggrieved person as Section 46 (1) of The 1958 Act relates only to the period upto the date of the filing of the rectification application and the rights of the parties crystallized at that stage itself In this regard,he relied upon a decision of the Madras High Court in Agha Hyder Hussain & Anr.v Omar Khayyam Wineries (Pvt Ltd.& Anr.(AIR 1977 Mad 166 1976 Indlaw MAD 380 He also placed reliance upon some more decisions viz; Ritz Hotel Ltd.(1989 RPC 333),Philosophy Di Alberta Ferretti (2003 R.P.C.15 Keystone Knitting Mills Trade Mark(1929 (1) Ch D.92) and Motor Terms Company Pty Limited.v Liberty Insurance Ltd.(1967 116 C.L.R.177).Learned counsel for the first respondent further submitted that the affidavit dated July 14,2004 was not placed by the appellant before the IPAB nor any reference of the said affidavit has been made in the written submissions before the IPAB and the appellant also did not make any effort to amend the pleadings that the first respondent was not an aggrieved person It was contended by Mr Vaibhav Gaggar that even otherwise in view of the fraud perpetrated by the appellant qua the registrations in question,the issue as to whether the first respondent had a dispute with the trade mark or not pales into insignificance as the primary duty of the court is to maintain the 'purity of the register'.He argued that in a case such as the present one since the allegations against the appellant relate to trafficking,squatting and non-user,the scope of 'person aggrieved' has to be enlarged Learned counsel submitted that the fact that the appellant continues to allege and that stance has not changed in the pleadings in SLP as well that the first respondent is an infringer,pilfriger,defrauder,someone who wants to ride on the goodwill of the appellant or someone who wants to mislead the public at large,there is no question of the first respondent ceasing to be a person aggrieved at any stage Vaibhav Gaggar,learned counsel for the first respondent contended that the appellant is registered as a 'manufacturer and trader' under Classes 7,9 and 16 even though,it is a company engaged in software only Moreover,there is nothing on record to indicate linkage with the manufacturing or marketing of the goods for which the appellant is holding registration of subject trade marks He vehemently contended that goods in Classes 7,9 and 16 for which the appellant obtained registration were never used in the manner contemplated by The 1958 Act for almost 30 years and that would show the mala fide intention of the appellant in having the same registered for the purpose of squatting and trafficking Learned counsel for the first respondent further argued that 'Infosys' is not an invented or a coined word; the said word is an abbreviation and combination of the words 'information system'; the word 'Infosys' has been used by various companies abroad as well as within India prior to incorporation of the appellant itself and hence cannot be called an invented word In this regard,he relied upon a decision of the Madras High Court in Nestle's Products (India Ltd.v P.Thankaraja Anr.(AIR 1978 Mad 336).He submitted that appellant is primarily in service industry which is unregistrable under The 1958 Act and since the appellant is not trading in the goods in respect of which it is registered,it cannot be said that the mark of the appellant is distinctive of its goods In any case,learned counsel would submit that the expression 'Infosys' is not descriptive expression Insofar as discretion exercised by IPAB in ordering removal of the appellant's registrations from the register under Section 46(1)(b) of The 1958 Act is concerned,learned counsel for the first respondent submitted that this Court should not overturn the discretion so exercised by the IPAB keeping in view the dishonest and fraudulent conduct of the appellant Lastly,he submitted that although no cross objections or cross appeal has been filed,the first respondent has some grievance with regard to the order of the IPAB in not considering the case set up in the rectification/removal applications particularly with regard to Section 56 of The 1958 Act Having regard to the order that we intend to make,we are not persuaded to accept the objection raised on behalf of the first respondent that present appeal preferred directly before this Court from the impugned order passed by the IPAB is not maintainable and must be dismissed as such Pertinently,the notice was issued in the petitions for special leave to appeal to the respondents on November 1,2004.In response to the said notice the first respondent filed counter affidavit before this Court on March 11,2005 wherein no specific objection about invocation of jurisdiction of this Court directly has been taken In the counter affidavit a very vague objection in the following terms was raised: \"That the present petition apart from being false and misconceived lacks the necessary jurisdiction,hence deserves outright rejection We are afraid,this is hardly an objection about maintainability Apart from it,on September 12,2005 after hearing both parties,special leave was granted by this Court In the backdrop of these peculiar facts,in our view,it is not appropriate to relegate the  17 appellant at this distance of time to challenge the impugned order passed by the IPAB in writ petition before the High Court The objection about maintainability of the appeals is,accordingly,overruled The moot question which has been debated before us is whether or not,the first respondent is an aggrieved person That the first respondent filed composite applications under Sections 46 and 56 of The 1958 Act for rectification/removal of the trade mark 'Infosys' registered in Classes 7,9 and 16 is not in dispute Sections 46 and 56 read as follows : \"S.46.Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use.--(1) Subject to the provisions of section 47,a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either: (a) that the trade mark was registered without any bona fide intention on the part of the applicant for registration that it should be used in relation to those goods by him or,in a case to which the provisions of section 45 apply,by the company concerned,and that there has,in fact,been no bona fide use of the trade mark in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being up to a date one month before the date of the application; or (b) that up to a date one month before the date of the application,a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered  18  and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being: Provided that,except where the applicant has been permitted under sub-section (3) of section 12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark,the tribunal may refuse an application under clause (a) or clause (b) in relation to any goods,if it is shown that there has been,before the relevant date or during the relevant period,as the case may be,bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for the time being in relation to goods of the same description,being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered 2) Where in relation to any goods in respect of which a trade mark is registered: (a) the circumstances referred to in clause (1) of sub-section (1) are shown to exist so far as regards non-use of the trade mark in relation to goods to be sold,or otherwise traded in,in a particular place in India (otherwise than for export from India),or in relation to goods to be exported to a particular market outside India; and (b) a person has been permitted under sub-section (3) of section 12 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of those goods under a registration extending to use in relation to goods to be so sold,or otherwise traded in,or in relation to goods to be so exported,or the tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark,on application by that person in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar,the tribunal may impose on the registration of the first-mentioned trade mark such limitations as it thinks proper for securing that that registration shall cease to extend to such use.19 (3 An applicant shall not be entitled to rely for the purpose of clause (b) of sub-section (1) or for the purposes of sub-section (2) on any non-use of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade and not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the application relates S.56.Power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register.(1 On application made in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved,the tribunal may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention,or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto Any person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry,or by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause,or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register,or by any error or defect in any entry in the register,may apply in the prescribed manner to a High Court or to the Registrar,and the tribunal may make such order for making,expunging or varying the entry as it may think fit The tribunal may in any proceeding under this section decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the register The tribunal,of its own motion,may,after giving notice in the prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard,make any order referred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2 Any order of the High Court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall be served upon the Registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the register accordingly The power to rectify the register conferred by this section shall include the power to remove a trade mark registered in Part A of the register to Part B of the register The position that emerges from the above provisions is this Whether the application is under Section 46 or under Section 56 or a composite application under both Sections,it is a pre-requisite that the applicant must be a person aggrieved Section 46(1) of The 1958 Act enables any person aggrieved to apply for removal of registered trade mark from the register on the ground of non use as stated in Clause (a) and/or Clause (b).To be an aggrieved person under Section 46,he must be one whose interest is affected in some possible way; it must not be a fanciful suggestion of grievance A likelihood of some injury or damage to the applicant by such trade mark remaining on the register may meet the test of locus standi In Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (11th edition) at page 166,the legal position with regard to 'person aggrieved' has been summarized thus The persons who are aggrieved are all persons who are in some way or the other substantially interested in having the mark removed where it is a question of removal from the register; including all persons who would be substantially damaged if the mark remained,and all trade rivals over whom an advantage was gained by a trader who was getting the benefit of a registered trade mark to which he was not entitled We accept the above statement of law Insofar as Section 56 is concerned,it provides for varying situations in which the person aggrieved may apply for rectification of the registered trade mark from the register Although both Sections,namely,Sections 46 and 56 require 'person aggrieved' to apply for removal of the registered trade mark from the register or rectification of a trade mark in the register,the expression 'person aggrieved' for the purposes of these two Sections has different connotations The interpretation of the expression 'person aggrieved' occurring in Sections 46 and 56 has come up for consideration before this Court on more than one occasion In Hardie Trading Ltd 2003 Indlaw SC 756.(2003) 11 SCC 92),this Court stated as follows: \" The phrase \"person aggrieved\" is a common enough statutory precondition for a valid complaint or appeal The phrase has been variously construed depending on the context in which it occurs Three sections viz Sections 46,56 and 69 of the Act contain the phrase Section 46 deals with the removal of a registered trade mark from the Register on the ground of non-use This section presupposes that the registration which was validly made is liable to be taken off by subsequent non-user Section 56 on the other hand deals with situations where the initial registration should not have been or was incorrectly made The situations covered by this section include: (a) the contravention or failure to observe a condition for registration; (b) the absence of an entry; (c) an entry made without sufficient cause; (d) a wrong entry; and (e) any error or defect in the entry Such type of actions are commenced for the \"purity of the Register\" which it is in public interest to maintain Applications under Sections 46 and 56 may be made to the Registrar who is competent to grant the relief.\"Persons aggrieved\" may also apply for cancellation or varying an entry in the Register relating to a certification trade mark to the Central Government in certain circumstances Since we are not concerned with a certification trade mark,the process for registration of which is entirely different,we may exclude the interpretation of the phrase \"person aggrieved\" occurring in Section 69 from consideration for the purposes of this judgment In our opinion the phrase \"person aggrieved\" for the purposes of removal on the ground of non-use under Section 46 has a different connotation from the phrase used in Section 56 for cancelling or expunging or varying an entry wrongly made or remaining in the Register In the latter case the locus standi would be ascertained liberally,since it would not only be against the interest of other persons carrying on the same trade but also in the interest of the public to have such wrongful entry removed It was in this sense that the House of Lords defined \"person aggrieved\" in the matter of Powell's Trade Mark: \"...although they were no doubt inserted to prevent officious interference by those who had no interest at all in the register being correct,and to exclude a mere common informer,it is undoubtedly of public interest that they should not be unduly limited,inasmuch as it is a public mischief that there should remain upon the register a mark which ought not to be there,and by which many persons may be affected,who,nevertheless,would not be willing to enter upon the risk and expense of litigation Whenever it can be shown,as here,that the applicant is in the same trade as the person who has registered the trade mark,and wherever the trade mark,if remaining on the register,would,or might,limit the legal rights of the applicant,so that by reason of the existence of the entry on the register he could not lawfully do that which,but for the existence of the mark upon the register,he could lawfully do,it appears to me he has a locus standi to be heard as a person aggrieved But if the ground for rectification is merely based on non-user i.e.under Section 46 of the Act,that is not really on account of any public mischief by way of an incorrect entry The non-user does not by itself render the entry incorrect but it gives a right to a person whose interest is affected to apply for its removal An applicant must therefore show that \"in some possible way he may be damaged or injured if the trade mark is allowed to stand; and by 'possible' I mean possible in a practical sense,and not merely in a fantastic view All cases of this kind,where the original registration is not illegal or improper,ought to be considered as questions of common sense,to a certain extent,at any rate; and I think the applicants ought to show something approaching a sufficient or proper reason for applying to have the trade mark expunged It certainly is not sufficient reason that they are at loggerheads with the respondents or desire in some way to injure them Addisons' application was one under Section 46 and the test to determine whether the applicant was a \"person aggrieved\" within the meaning of that section should have been the one laid down by Romer,J.in Wright case and not the one propounded by the House of Lords in the matter of Powell's Trade Mark The High Court and the Joint Registrar fell into error in not drawing this distinction However,it is not necessary to dilate on this aspect of the matter as the appellant has really argued on the second and third aspects of Section 46 viz.the alleged non-use of the trade marks by Hardie and special circumstances In the case of Hardie Trading Ltd 2003 Indlaw SC 756.1,this Court approved the test applied by Romer,J.in The Royal Baking Powder Company v Wright,Crossley,and Co.(1898 15 RPC 677),which has been reproduced in the report We respectfully agree Hardie Trading Ltd 2003 Indlaw SC 756.1 has been followed by this Court in a recent decision in the case of Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba  (2008) 10 SCC 766) 2008 Indlaw SC 1395 This Court stated that Section 46 speaks for private interest while Section 56 speaks of a public interest It is true that the appellant in opposition to the applications for removal/rectification of trade mark did not specifically challenge in its counter affidavits the locus standi of the first respondent to be heard as a person aggrieved Obviously,in the absence of any specific objection by the appellant to that effect,no specific issue was framed by the High Court whether the applicant was an aggrieved person The applications having been transferred to the IPAB in terms of Section 100 of the 1999 Act,the IPAB examined the matter in light of the issues that were framed by the High Court although in the written submissions before it,the objection was raised that the first respondent has ceased to have locus standi in view of the subsequent events,particularly change of the name of the first respondent from Jupiter Infosys Ltd.to Jupiter International Ltd The question is,whether in these circumstances it was incumbent upon the IPAB to consider and satisfy itself about the locus standi of the first respondent to be heard as a person aggrieved In our considered view,it was In the first place,when the first respondent applied for rectification/removal in respect of three registrations in Classes 7,9 and 16,it must have shown in respect of each of them that it is a 'person aggrieved' and the IPAB must have separately considered in respect of each registration the locus standi of the first respondent as the considerations for each entry might not have been common Secondly,and more importantly,during the pendency of the applications,certain events had taken place which had some bearing on the question of locus standi of the first respondent insofar as invocation of Section 46 (1) of The 1958 Act is concerned In the affidavit filed by the first respondent on July 14,2004 before the Court of Additional District Judge,Delhi an unequivocal and categorical statement has been made that now there is no dispute between the plaintiff (appellant herein) and defendant (first respondent herein) under the Trade Mark and that defendant has already changed the Trade Mark namely \"Jupiter International Ltd.\" in place of \"Jupiter Infosys Ltd In terms of Section 46(1),not only that the applicant has to show that he is an aggrieved person as his interest is being affected but the IPAB must also be satisfied,before it directs the removal of registered trade mark,that the applicant is an aggrieved person before it invokes the power in directing the removal of the  26 registered trade mark This is so because the pre-requisite for exercise of power under Section 46(1) is that the applicant is a person aggrieved The question then arises,whether it is sufficient for the applicant to show that he is a person aggrieved when he makes his application or he must continue to remain a person aggrieved until such time as the rectification/removal application is finally decided In our view,the grievance of the applicant when he invokes Section 46(1) must not only be taken to have existed on the date of making application but must continue to exist when such application is decided If during the pendency of such application,the applicant's cause of complaint does not survive or his grievance does not subsist due to his own action or the applicant has waived his right or he has lost his interest for any other reason,there may not be any justification for rectification as the registered trade mark cannot be said to operate prejudicially to his interest In re Apollinaris Company's Trade-Marks,while dealing with this aspect,Kekemich,J.stated : \".....because that is a remedy given to the person aggrieved through the interposition of the Court for the benefit of the 14 (1891) 2 Ch.186  27  applicant,and if at the date of the trial he has no cause of complaint it seems to be monstrous to suppose that the Court will rectify the register at his instance when it can do him no good to rectify,and when the retention on the register can do him no harm merely because at the date of his application he may have had some grievance We concur with the above statement In the circumstances,we are satisfied that the applications made by the first respondent for rectification/removal of the subject trade marks from the register need to be considered afresh by the IPAB in accordance with law and the observations made above Since the first respondent has also grievance in connection with the impugned order particularly with regard to non-consideration of its case under Section 56 of The 1958 Act,we refrain from going into the merits of the diverse contentions raised before us and leave the parties to agitate these contentions before the IPAB In view of the above,these appeals are allowed in part and the impugned order dated September 9,2004 is set aside The applications being TRA Nos.25 to 27 of 2003 (OP Nos.764 to 766 of 2001) are restored to the file of Intellectual Property Appellate Board,Chennai for hearing and disposal afresh in accordance with law The parties shall bear their own costs Appeals allowed",
